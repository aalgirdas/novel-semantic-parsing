Imagine that you are a novel text critic and a semantic information analyst. Your goal is to create two taxonomic systems that will help classify sentences and paragraphs in a novel. The first system is for sentences that are not part of a dialogue, that is, a narrative, and the second system is to classify sentences that are dialogue sentences between characters in the book.

It is very important to distinguish between these systems that they will be used to describe a scene in a film adaptation or a play or a game scene. That is, to distinguish objects and actions that are important to the scene and to distinguish sentences that cannot be directly depicted on the stage.
The taxonomic system must be general enough, its elements must be suitable for both film adaptation and game or play creation, regardless of the type of work.

Create these two taxonomic systems and submit the answer in JSON format. I will use JSON as part of the prompt for the LLM model, so make JSON as suitable as possible for such a prompt.

The JSON for the LLM model prompt should have time description attributes, which should be filled in by the LLM model.
