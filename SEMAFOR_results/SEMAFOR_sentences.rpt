2125088     588         Arthur Conan Doyle
2125089     588         The Hound of the Baskervilles
2125090     588         Chapter 1 – Mr. Sherlock Holmes
2125091     588         Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table.
2125092     588         I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a "Penang lawyer."
2125093     588         Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across.
2125094     588         "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.," was engraved upon it, with the date
2125095     588         "1884."
2125096     588         It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry – dignified, solid, and reassuring.
2125097     588         "Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"
2125098     588         Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.
2125099     588         "How did you know what I was doing?
2125100     588         I believe you have eyes in the back of your head."
2125101     588         "I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me," said he.
2125102     588         "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick?
2125103     588         Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
2125104     588         Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it."
2125105     588         "I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation."
2125106     588         "Good!" said Holmes.
2125107     588         "Excellent!"
2125108     588         "I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."
2125109     588         "Why so?"
2125110     588         "Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
2125111     588         The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it."
2125112     588         "Perfectly sound!" said Holmes.
2125113     588         "And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.'
2125114     588         I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return."
2125115     588         "Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette.
2125116     588         "I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities.
2125117     588         It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light.
2125118     588         Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it.
2125119     588         I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."
2125120     588         He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods.
2125121     588         I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval.
2125122     588         He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes.
2125123     588         Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
2125124     588         "Interesting, though elementary," said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee.
2125125     588         "There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions."
2125126     588         "Has anything escaped me?" I asked with some self-importance.
2125127     588         "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"
2125128     588         "I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous.
2125129     588         When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
2125130     588         Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance.
2125131     588         The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal."
2125132     588         "Then I was right."
2125133     588         "To that extent."
2125134     588         "But that was all."
2125135     588         "No, no, my dear Watson, not all – by no means all.
2125136     588         I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words
2125137     588         'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."
2125138     588         "You may be right."
2125139     588         "The probability lies in that direction.
2125140     588         And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor."
2125141     588         "Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for
2125142     588         'Charing Cross Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"
2125143     588         "Do none suggest themselves?
2125144     588         You know my methods.
2125145     588         Apply them!"
2125146     588         "I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country."
2125147     588         "I think that we might venture a little farther than this.
2125148     588         Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?
2125149     588         When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will?
2125150     588         Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself.
2125151     588         We know there has been a presentation.
2125152     588         We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice.
2125153     588         Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?"
2125154     588         "It certainly seems probable."
2125155     588         "Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of ohe hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
2125156     588         What was he, then?
2125157     588         If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surpeon or a house-physician – little more than a senior student.
2125158     588         And he left five years ago – the date is on the stick.
2125159     588         So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger
2125160     588         I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
2125161     588         "As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said I, "but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career."
2125162     588         From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name.
2125163     588         There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.
2125164     588         "Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
2125165     588         House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
2125166     588         Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled
2125167     588         'Is Disease a Reversion?'
2125168     588         Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society.
2125169     588         Author of
2125170     588         'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).
2125171     588         'Do We Progress?' (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).
2125172     588         Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow."
2125173     588         "No mention of that local hunt, Watson," said Holmes with a mischievous smile, "but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed.
2125174     588         I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences.
2125175     588         As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.
2125176     588         It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an 
2125177     588         "And the dog?"
2125178     588         "Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.
2125179     588         Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible.
2125180     588         The dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff.
2125181     588         It may have been – yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel."
2125182     588         He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window.
2125183     588         There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.
2125184     588         "My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"
2125185     588         "For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner.
2125186     588         Don't move, I beg you, Watson.
2125187     588         He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me.
2125188     588         Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.
2125189     588         What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime?
2125190     588         Come in!"
2125191     588         The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner.
2125192     588         He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses.
2125193     588         He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed.
2125194     588         Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence.
2125195     588         As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy.
2125196     588         "I am so very glad," said he.
2125197     588         "I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office.
2125198     588         I would not lose that stick for the world."
2125199     588         "A presentation, I see," said Holmes.
2125200     588         "Yes, sir."
2125201     588         "From Charing Cross Hospital?"
2125202     588         "From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage."
2125203     588         "Dear, dear, that's bad!" said Holmes, shaking his head.
2125204     588         Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.
2125205     588         "Why was it bad?"
2125206     588         "Only that you have disarranged our little deductions.
2125207     588         Your marriage, you say?"
2125208     588         "Yes, sir.
2125209     588         I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice.
2125210     588         It was necessary to make a home of my own."
2125211     588         "Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all," said Holmes.
2125212     588         "And now, Dr. James Mortimer –"
2125213     588         "Mister, sir, Mister – a humble M.R.C.S."
2125214     588         "And a man of precise mind, evidently."
2125215     588         "A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean.
2125216     588         I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not –"
2125217     588         "No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."
2125218     588         "Glad to meet you, sir.
2125219     588         I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend.
2125220     588         You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes.
2125221     588         I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development.
2125222     588         Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure?
2125223     588         A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum.
2125224     588         It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull."
2125225     588         Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.
2125226     588         "You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine," said he.
2125227     588         "I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes.
2125228     588         Have no hesitation in lighting one."
2125229     588         The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity.
2125230     588         He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.
2125231     588         Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion.
2125232     588         "I presume, sir," said he at last, "that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again to-day?"
2125233     588         "No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem.
2125234     588         Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe –"
2125235     588         "Indeed, sir!
2125236     588         May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?" asked Holmes with some asperity.
2125237     588         "To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly."
2125238     588         "Then had you not better consult him?"
2125239     588         "I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.
2125240     588         I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently –"
2125241     588         "Just a little," said Holmes.
2125242     588         "I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance."
2125243     588         Chapter 2 – The Curse of the Baskervilles
2125244     588         "I have in my pocket a manuscript," said Dr. James Mortimer.
2125245     588         "I observed it as you entered the room," said Holmes.
2125246     588         "It is an old manuscript."
2125247     588         "Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery."
2125248     588         "How can you say that, sir?"
2125249     588         "You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking.
2125250     588         It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.
2125251     588         You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.
2125252     588         I put that at 1730."
2125253     588         "The exact date is 1742."
2125254     588         Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
2125255     588         "This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire.
2125256     588         I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.
2125257     588         He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself.
2125258     588         Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him."
2125259     588         Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee.
2125260     588         "You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short.
2125261     588         It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date."
2125262     588         I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script.
2125263     588         At the head was written:
2125264     588         "Baskerville Hall," and below in large, scrawling figures:
2125265     588         "1742."
2125266     588         "It appears to be a statement of some sort."
2125267     588         "Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family."
2125268     588         "But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?"
2125269     588         "Most modern.
2125270     588         A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours.
2125271     588         But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair.
2125272     588         With your permission I will read it to you."
2125273     588         Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation.
2125274     588         Dr. Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:
2125275     588         "Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even
2125276     588         And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.
2125277     588         Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.
2125278     588         "Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, prof
2125279     588         This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a byword through the West.
2125280     588         It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.
2125281     588         But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name.
2125282     588         So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew.
2125283     588         When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom.
2125284     588         Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who sai
2125285     588         At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor,
2125286     588         "It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink – with other worse things, perchance – to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped.
2125287     588         Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night 
2125288     588         And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mar
2125289     588         "Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to understand all that had been done in such haste.
2125290     588         But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands.
2125291     588         Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of wine.
2125292     588         But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in pursuit.
2125293     588         The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.
2125294     588         "They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt.
2125295     588         And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.
2125296     588         'But I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.'
2125297     588         So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.
2125298     588         But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle.
2125299     588         Then the revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse's head.
2125300     588         Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.
2125301     588         These, though known for their valour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before t
2125302     588         "The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started.
2125303     588         The most of them would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.
2125304     588         Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.
2125305     588         The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue.
2125306     588         But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerviile lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three daredevil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood
2125307     588         And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.
2125308     588         One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.
2125309     588         "Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since.
2125310     588         If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed.
2125311     588         Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.
2125312     588         Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.
2125313     588         To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.
2125314     588         " "
2125315     588         When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
2125316     588         The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.
2125317     588         "Well?" said he.
2125318     588         "Do you not find it interesting?"
2125319     588         "To a collector of fairy tales."
2125320     588         Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
2125321     588         "Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent.
2125322     588         This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year.
2125323     588         It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date."
2125324     588         My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent.
2125325     588         Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:
2125326     588         "The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.
2125327     588         Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him.
2125328     588         In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.
2125329     588         Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation.
2125330     588         More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his gains and returned to England with them.
2125331     588         It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death.
2125332     588         Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.
2125333     588         His generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.
2125334     588         "The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.
2125335     588         There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.
2125336     588         Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.
2125337     588         In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and bis indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
2125338     588         Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attac
2125339     588         Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.
2125340     588         "The facts of the case are simple.
2125341     588         Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.
2125342     588         The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.
2125343     588         On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a c
2125344     588         He never returned.
2125345     588         At twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.
2125346     588         The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's footmarks were easily traced down the alley.
2125347     588         Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.
2125348     588         There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered.
2125349     588         One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes.
2125350     588         One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came.
2125351     588         No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion – so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who 
2125352     588         This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.
2125353     588         It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted.
2125354     588         Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.
2125355     588         It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's younger brother.
2125356     588         The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune."
2125357     588         Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.
2125358     588         "Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville."
2125359     588         "I must thank you," said Sherlock Holmes, "for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest.
2125360     588         I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases.
2125361     588         This article, you say, contains all the public facts?"
2125362     588         "It does."
2125363     588         "Then let me have the private ones."
2125364     588         He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.
2125365     588         "In doing so," said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, "I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.
2125366     588         My motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.
2125367     588         I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
2125368     588         For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.
2125369     588         "The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together.
2125370     588         For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville.
2125371     588         With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles.
2125372     588         Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.
2125373     588         He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.
2125374     588         "Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point.
2125375     588         He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart – so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night.
2125376     588         Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging.
2125377     588         The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound.
2125378     588         The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.
2125379     588         "I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event.
2125380     588         He chanced to be at his hall door.
2125381     588         I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror.
2125382     588         I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive.
2125383     588         So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it.
2125384     588         It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind.
2125385     588         I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came.
2125386     588         I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.
2125387     588         "It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.
2125388     588         His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health.
2125389     588         I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man.
2125390     588         Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion.
2125391     588         At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
2125392     588         "On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event.
2125393     588         I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest.
2125394     588         I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft g
2125395     588         Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. TheFe was certainly no physical injury of any kind.
2125396     588         But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest.
2125397     588         He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body.
2125398     588         He did not observe any.
2125399     588         But I did – some little distance off, but fresh and clear."
2125400     588         "Footprints?"
2125401     588         "Footprints. "
2125402     588         "A man's or a woman's?"
2125403     588         Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:
2125404     588         "Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!"
2125405     588         Chapter 3 – The Problem
2125406     588         I confess at these words a shudder passed through me.
2125407     588         There was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us.
2125408     588         Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.
2125409     588         "You saw this?"
2125410     588         "As clearly as I see you."
2125411     588         "And you said nothing?"
2125412     588         "What was the use?"
2125413     588         "How was it that no one else saw it?"
2125414     588         "The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought.
2125415     588         I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend."
2125416     588         "There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?"
2125417     588         "No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog."
2125418     588         "You say it was large?"
2125419     588         "Enormous. "
2125420     588         "But it had not approached the body?"
2125421     588         "No."
2125422     588         "What sort of night was it?'
2125423     588         "Damp and raw."
2125424     588         "But not actually raining?"
2125425     588         "No."
2125426     588         "What is the alley like?"
2125427     588         "There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable.
2125428     588         The walk in the centre is about eight feet across."
2125429     588         "Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?"
2125430     588         "Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side."
2125431     588         "I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?"
2125432     588         "Yes, the wicket gate which leads on to the moor."
2125433     588         "Is there any other opening?"
2125434     588         "None."
2125435     588         "So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate?"
2125436     588         "There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end."
2125437     588         "Had Sir Charles reached this?"
2125438     588         "No; he lay about fifty yards from it."
2125439     588         "Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer – and this is important – the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?"
2125440     588         "No marks could show on the grass."
2125441     588         "Were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate?"
2125442     588         "Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor gate."
2125443     588         "You interest me exceedingly.
2125444     588         Another point. Was the wicketgate closed?"
2125445     588         "Closed and padlocked."
2125446     588         "How high was it?"
2125447     588         "About four feet high."
2125448     588         "Then anyone could have got over it?"
2125449     588         "Yes."
2125450     588         "And what marks did you see by the wicket gate?"
2125451     588         "None in particular."
2125452     588         "Good heaven!
2125453     588         Did no one examine?"
2125454     588         "Yes, I examined, myself."
2125455     588         "And found nothing?"
2125456     588         "It was all very confused.
2125457     588         Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes."
2125458     588         "How do you know that?"
2125459     588         "Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar."
2125460     588         "Excellent!
2125461     588         This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart.
2125462     588         But the marks?"
2125463     588         "He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel.
2125464     588         I could discern no others."
2125465     588         Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture.
2125466     588         "If I had only been there!" he cried.
2125467     588         "It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert.
2125468     588         That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants.
2125469     588         Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in!
2125470     588         You have indeed much to answer for."
2125471     588         "I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.
2125472     588         Besides, besides –"
2125473     588         "Why do you hesitate?"
2125474     588         "There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless."
2125475     588         "You mean that the thing is supernatural?"
2125476     588         "I did not positively say so."
2125477     588         "No, but you evidently think it."
2125478     588         "Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature."
2125479     588         "For example?"
2125480     588         "I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science.
2125481     588         They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral.
2125482     588         I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend.
2125483     588         I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night."
2125484     588         "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"
2125485     588         "I do not know what to believe."
2125486     588         Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
2125487     588         "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
2125488     588         "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task.
2125489     588         Yet you must admit that the footmark is material."
2125490     588         "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well."
2125491     588         "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists.
2125492     588         But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this.
2125493     588         If you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all?
2125494     588         You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it."
2125495     588         "I did not say that I desired you to do it."
2125496     588         "Then, how can I assist you?"
2125497     588         "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station" – Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch – "in exactly one hour and a quarter."
2125498     588         "He being the heir?"
2125499     588         "Yes.
2125500     588         On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada.
2125501     588         From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way.
2125502     588         I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will."
2125503     588         "There is no other claimant, I presume?"
2125504     588         "None.
2125505     588         The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder.
2125506     588         The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry.
2125507     588         The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family.
2125508     588         He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo.
2125509     588         He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever.
2125510     588         Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
2125511     588         In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station.
2125512     588         I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning.
2125513     588         Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"
2125514     588         "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"
2125515     588         "It seems natural, does it not?
2125516     588         And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate.
2125517     588         I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place.
2125518     588         And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence.
2125519     588         All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall.
2125520     588         I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice."
2125521     588         Holmes considered for a little time.
2125522     588         "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he.
2125523     588         "In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville – that is your opinion?"
2125524     588         "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so."
2125525     588         "Exactly.
2125526     588         But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire.
2125527     588         A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing."
2125528     588         "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things.
2125529     588         Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London.
2125530     588         He comes in fifty minutes.
2125531     588         What would you recommend?"
2125532     588         "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville."
2125533     588         "And then?"
2125534     588         "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter."
2125535     588         "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"
2125536     588         "Twenty-four hours.
2125537     588         At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you."
2125538     588         "I will do so, Mr. Holmes."
2125539     588         He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absentminded fashion.
2125540     588         Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.
2125541     588         "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer.
2125542     588         You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?"
2125543     588         "Three people did."
2125544     588         "Did any see it after?"
2125545     588         "I have not heard of any."
2125546     588         "Thank you.
2125547     588         Good-morning."
2125548     588         Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.
2125549     588         "Going out, Watson?"
2125550     588         "Unless I can help you."
2125551     588         "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid.
2125552     588         But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.
2125553     588         When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco?
2125554     588         Thank you.
2125555     588         It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening.
2125556     588         Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submined to us this morning."
2125557     588         I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind a
2125558     588         I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more. My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was s
2125559     588         As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing.
2125560     588         Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips.
2125561     588         Several rolls of paper lay around him.
2125562     588         "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.
2125563     588         "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."
2125564     588         "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."
2125565     588         "Thick!
2125566     588         It is intolerable."
2125567     588         "Open the window, then!
2125568     588         You have been at your club all day, I perceive."
2125569     588         "My dear Holmes!"
2125570     588         "Am I right?"
2125571     588         "Certainly, but how?"
2125572     588         He laughed at my bewildered expression.
2125573     588         "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense.
2125574     588         A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day.
2125575     588         He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots.
2125576     588         He has been a fixture therefore all day.
2125577     588         He is not a man with intimate friends.
2125578     588         Where, then, could he have been?
2125579     588         Is it not obvious?"
2125580     588         "Well, it is rather obvious."
2125581     588         "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.
2125582     588         Where do you think that I have been?"
2125583     588         "A fixture also."
2125584     588         "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."
2125585     588         "In spirit?"
2125586     588         "Exactly.
2125587     588         My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco.
2125588     588         After you left I sent down to Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day.
2125589     588         I flatter myself that I could find my way about."
2125590     588         "A large-scale map, I presume?"
2125591     588         "Very large."
2125592     588         He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
2125593     588         "Here you have the particular district which concerns us.
2125594     588         That is Baskerville Hall in the middle."
2125595     588         "With a wood round it?"
2125596     588         "Exactly.
2125597     588         I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it.
2125598     588         This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters.
2125599     588         Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
2125600     588         Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
2125601     588         There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist – Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name.
2125602     588         Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire.
2125603     588         Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown.
2125604     588         Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor.
2125605     588         This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again."
2125606     588         "It must be a wild place."
2125607     588         "Yes, the setting is a worthy one.
2125608     588         If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men –"
2125609     588         "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."
2125610     588         "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?
2125611     588         There are two questions waiting for us at the outset.
2125612     588         The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed?
2125613     588         Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our investigation.
2125614     588         But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one.
2125615     588         I think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind.
2125616     588         It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought.
2125617     588         I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions.
2125618     588         Have you turned the case over in your mind?"
2125619     588         "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."
2125620     588         "What do you make of it?"
2125621     588         "It is very bewildering."
2125622     588         "It has certainly a character of its own.
2125623     588         There are points of distinction about it.
2125624     588         That change in the footprints, for example.
2125625     588         What do you make of that?"
2125626     588         "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley."
2125627     588         "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"
2125628     588         "What then?"
2125629     588         "He was running, Watson – running desperately, running for his life, running until he burst his heart-and fell dead upon his face."
2125630     588         "Running from what?"
2125631     588         "There lies our problem.
2125632     588         There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run."
2125633     588         "How can you say that?"
2125634     588         "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.
2125635     588         If that were so, and it seems most probable only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it.
2125636     588         If the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be.
2125637     588         Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house?"
2125638     588         "You think that he was waiting for someone?"
2125639     588         "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.
2125640     588         Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"
2125641     588         "But he went out every evening."
2125642     588         "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every evening.
2125643     588         On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor.
2125644     588         That night he waited there.
2125645     588         It was the night before he made his departure for London.
2125646     588         The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent.
2125647     588         Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."
2125648     588         Chapter 4 – Sir Henry Baskerville
2125649     588         Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the promised interview.
2125650     588         Our clients were punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.
2125651     588         The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face.
2125652     588         He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman.
2125653     588         "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.
2125654     588         "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own account.
2125655     588         I understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it."
2125656     588         "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry.
2125657     588         Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?"
2125658     588         "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes.
2125659     588         Only a joke, as like as not.
2125660     588         It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this morning."
2125661     588         He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it.
2125662     588         It was of common quality, grayish in colour.
2125663     588         The address,
2125664     588         "Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
2125665     588         "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding evening.
2125666     588         "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.
2125667     588         "No one could have known.
2125668     588         We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."
2125669     588         "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"
2125670     588         "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor.
2125671     588         "There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."
2125672     588         "Hum!
2125673     588         Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
2125674     588         Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
2125675     588         This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it.
2125676     588         It ran:
2125677     588         As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.
2125678     588         The word "moor" only was printed in ink.
2125679     588         "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?"
2125680     588         "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer?
2125681     588         You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"
2125682     588         "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural."
2125683     588         "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply.
2125684     588         "It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."
2125685     588         "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
2125686     588         I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes.
2125687     588         "We will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening.
2125688     588         Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"
2125689     588         "It is here in the corner."
2125690     588         "Might I trouble you for it – the inside page, please, with the leading articles?"
2125691     588         He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the columns.
2125692     588         "Capital article this on free trade.
2125693     588         Permit me to give you an extract from it.
2125694     588         "You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our i
2125695     588         "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction.
2125696     588         "Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?"
2125697     588         Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.
2125698     588         "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said he, "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned."
2125699     588         "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir Henry.
2125700     588         Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence."
2125701     588         "No, I confess that I see no connection."
2125702     588         "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other.
2125703     588         'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,' 'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence these words have been taken?"
2125704     588         "By thunder, you're right!
2125705     588         Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir Henry.
2125706     588         "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."
2125707     588         "Well, now – so it is!"
2125708     588         "Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.
2125709     588         "I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known.
2125710     588         How did you do it?"
2125711     588         "I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimau?"
2125712     588         "Most certainly."
2125713     588         "But how?"
2125714     588         "Because that is my special hobby.
2125715     588         The differences are obvious.
2125716     588         The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the –"
2125717     588         "But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.
2125718     588         There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau.
2125719     588         The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News.
2125720     588         But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
2125721     588         As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue."
2125722     588         "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors –"
2125723     588         "Nail-scissors," said Holmes.
2125724     588         "You can see that it was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep away.' "
2125725     588         "That is so.
2125726     588         Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste –"
2125727     588         "Gum," said Holmes.
2125728     588         "With gum on to the paper.
2125729     588         But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?"
2125730     588         "Because he could not find it in print.
2125731     588         The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common."
2125732     588         "Why, of course, that would explain it.
2125733     588         Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?"
2125734     588         "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues.
2125735     588         The address, you observe is printed in rough characters.
2125736     588         But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated.
2125737     588         We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you.
2125738     588         Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
2125739     588         'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place.
2125740     588         That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.
2125741     588         On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless.
2125742     588         If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel.
2125743     588         Did the composer fear an interruption – and from whom?"
2125744     588         "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr. Mortimer.
2125745     588         "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely.
2125746     588         It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation.
2125747     588         Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."
2125748     588         "How in the world can you say that?"
2125749     588         "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble.
2125750     588         The pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.
2125751     588         Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare.
2125752     588         But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else.
2125753     588         Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular me
2125754     588         Halloa!
2125755     588         Halloa!
2125756     588         What's this?"
2125757     588         He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.
2125758     588         "Well?"
2125759     588         "Nothing," said he, throwing it down.
2125760     588         "It is a blank halfsheet of paper, without even a watermark upon it.
2125761     588         I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in London?"
2125762     588         "Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not."
2125763     588         "You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?"
2125764     588         "I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel," said our visitor.
2125765     588         "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?"
2125766     588         "We are coming to that.
2125767     588         You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?"
2125768     588         "Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting."
2125769     588         "I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting."
2125770     588         Sir Henry smiled.
2125771     588         "I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada.
2125772     588         But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here."
2125773     588         "You have lost one of your boots?"
2125774     588         "My dear sir," cried Dr. Mortimer, "it is only mislaid.
2125775     588         You will find it when you return to the hotel.
2125776     588         What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?"
2125777     588         "Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine."
2125778     588         "Exactly," said Holmes, "however foolish the incident may seem.
2125779     588         You have lost one of your boots, you say?"
2125780     588         "Well, mislaid it, anyhow.
2125781     588         I put them both outside my door last night, and there was only one in the morning.
2125782     588         I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them.
2125783     588         The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on."
2125784     588         "If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?"
2125785     588         "They were tan boots and had never been varnished.
2125786     588         That was why I put them out."
2125787     588         "Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?"
2125788     588         "I did a good deal of shopping.
2125789     588         Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.
2125790     588         You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West.
2125791     588         Among other things I bought these brown boots – gave six dollars for them – and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet."
2125792     588         "It seems a singularly useless thing to steal," said Sherlock Holmes.
2125793     588         "I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found."
2125794     588         "And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know.
2125795     588         It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at."
2125796     588         "Your request is a very reasonable one," Holmes answered.
2125797     588         "Dr. Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us."
2125798     588         Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
2125799     588         Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.
2125800     588         "Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance," said he when the long narrative was finished.
2125801     588         "Of course, I've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery.
2125802     588         It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before.
2125803     588         But as to my uncle's death – well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet.
2125804     588         You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman."
2125805     588         "Precisely."
2125806     588         "And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel.
2125807     588         I suppose that fits into its place."
2125808     588         "It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor," said Dr. Mortimer.
2125809     588         "And also," said Holmes, "that someone is not ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of danger."
2125810     588         "Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away."
2125811     588         "Well, of course, that is possible also.
2125812     588         I am very much indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives.
2125813     588         But the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall."
2125814     588         "Why should I not go?"
2125815     588         "There seems to be danger."
2125816     588         "Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?"
2125817     588         "Well, that is what we have to find out."
2125818     588         "Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer."
2125819     588         His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke.
2125820     588         It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative.
2125821     588         "Meanwhile," said he, "I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me.
2125822     588         It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting.
2125823     588         I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind.
2125824     588         Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel.– Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at two.
2125825     588         I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me."
2125826     588         "Is that convenient to you, Watson?"
2125827     588         "Perfectly."
2125828     588         "Then you may expect us.
2125829     588         Shall I have a cab called?"
2125830     588         "I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather."
2125831     588         "I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure," said his companion.
2125832     588         "Then we meet again at two o'clock.
2125833     588         Au revoir, and good-morning!"
2125834     588         We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door.
2125835     588         In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action.
2125836     588         "Your hat and boots, Watson, quick!
2125837     588         Not a moment to lose!"
2125838     588         He rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock-coat.
2125839     588         We hurried together down the stairs and into the street.
2125840     588         Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.
2125841     588         "Shall I run on and stop them?"
2125842     588         "Not for the world, my dear Watson.
2125843     588         I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine.
2125844     588         Our friends are wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."
2125845     588         He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half.
2125846     588         Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.
2125847     588         Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the same.
2125848     588         An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again.
2125849     588         "There's our man, Watson!
2125850     588         Come along!
2125851     588         We'll have a good look at him, if we can do no more."
2125852     588         At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
2125853     588         Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.
2125854     588         Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no-empty one was in sight.
2125855     588         Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.
2125856     588         "There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles.
2125857     588         "Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?
2125858     588         Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes!"
2125859     588         "Who was the man?"
2125860     588         "I have not an idea."
2125861     588         "A spy?"
2125862     588         "Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town.
2125863     588         How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen?
2125864     588         If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second.
2125865     588         You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend."
2125866     588         "Yes, I remember."
2125867     588         "I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.
2125868     588         We are dealing with a clever man, Watson.
2125869     588         This matter cuts very deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of power and design.
2125870     588         When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant.
2125871     588         So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.
2125872     588         His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them.
2125873     588         It has, however, one obvious disadvantage."
2125874     588         "It puts him in the power of the cabman."
2125875     588         "Exactly."
2125876     588         "What a pity we did not get the number!"
2125877     588         "My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No.
2125878     588         2704 is our man.
2125879     588         But that is no use to us for the moment."
2125880     588         "I fail to see how you could have done more."
2125881     588         "On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waite
2125882     588         When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for.
2125883     588         As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man."
2125884     588         We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us.
2125885     588         "There is no object in our following them," said Holmes.
2125886     588         "The shadow has departed and will not return.
2125887     588         We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision.
2125888     588         Could you swear to that man's face within the cab?"
2125889     588         "I could swear only to the beard."
2125890     588         "And so could I – from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one.
2125891     588         A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features.
2125892     588         Come in here, Watson!"
2125893     588         He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was warmly greeted by the manager.
2125894     588         "Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?"
2125895     588         "No, sir, indeed I have not.
2125896     588         You saved my good name, and perhaps my life."
2125897     588         "My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability during the investigation."
2125898     588         "Yes, sir, he is still with us."
2125899     588         "Could you ring him up? – thank you!
2125900     588         And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note."
2125901     588         A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the manager.
2125902     588         He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective.
2125903     588         "Let me have the Hotel Directory," said Holmes.
2125904     588         "Thank you!
2125905     588         Now, Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross.
2125906     588         Do you see?"
2125907     588         "Yes, sir."
2125908     588         "You will visit each of these in turn."
2125909     588         "Yes, sir."
2125910     588         "You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.
2125911     588         Here are twenty-three shillings."
2125912     588         "Yes, sir."
2125913     588         "You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.
2125914     588         You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it.
2125915     588         You understand?"
2125916     588         "Yes, sir."
2125917     588         "But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with scissors.
2125918     588         Here is a copy of the Times. It is this page.
2125919     588         You could easily recognize it, could you not?"
2125920     588         "Yes, sir."
2125921     588         "In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom also you will give a shilling.
2125922     588         Here are twenty-three shillings.
2125923     588         You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed.
2125924     588         In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it.
2125925     588         The odds are enormously against your finding it.
2125926     588         There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies.
2125927     588         Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening.
2125928     588         And now, Watson, it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel."
2125929     588         Chapter 5 – Three Broken Threads
2125930     588         Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will.
2125931     588         For two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.
2125932     588         He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.
2125933     588         "Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you," said the clerk.
2125934     588         "He asked me to show you up at once when you came."
2125935     588         "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?" said Holmes.
2125936     588         "Not in the least."
2125937     588         The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.
2125938     588         One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.
2125939     588         "Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know," said Holmes to the porter.
2125940     588         "A lawyer, is he not, grayheaded, and walks with a limp?"
2125941     588         "No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman, not older than yourself."
2125942     588         "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?"
2125943     588         "No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well known to us."
2125944     588         "Ah, that settles it.
2125945     588         Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.
2125946     588         Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds another."
2125947     588         "She is an invalid lady, sir.
2125948     588         Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.
2125949     588         She always comes to us when she is in town."
2125950     588         "Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance.
2125951     588         We have established a most important fact by these questions, Watson," he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together.
2125952     588         "We know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel.
2125953     588         That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see them.
2125954     588         Now, this is a most suggestive fact."
2125955     588         "What does it suggest?"
2125956     588         "It suggests – halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?"
2125957     588         As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself.
2125958     588         His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands.
2125959     588         So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.
2125960     588         "Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel," he cried.
2125961     588         "They'll find they've stafted in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they've got a bit over the mark this time."
2125962     588         "Still looking for your boot?"
2125963     588         "Yes, sir, and mean to find it."
2125964     588         "But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?"
2125965     588         "So it was, sir.
2125966     588         And now it's an old black one."
2125967     588         "What! you don't mean to say ?"
2125968     588         "That's just what I do mean to say.
2125969     588         I only had three pairs in the world – the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am wearing.
2125970     588         Last night they took one of my brown ones, and to-day they have sneaked one of the black.
2125971     588         Well, have you got it?
2125972     588         Speak out, man, and don't stand staring!"
2125973     588         An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.
2125974     588         "No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it."
2125975     588         "Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel."
2125976     588         "It shall be found, sir – I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found."
2125977     588         "Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den of thieves.
2125978     588         Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle –"
2125979     588         "I think it's well worth troubling about."
2125980     588         "Why, you look very serious over it."
2125981     588         "How do you explain it?"
2125982     588         "I just don't attempt to explain it.
2125983     588         It seems the very maddest, queerest thing that ever happened to me."
2125984     588         "The queerest perhaps –" said Holmes thoughtfully.
2125985     588         "What do you make of it yourself?"
2125986     588         "Well, I don't profess to understand it yet.
2125987     588         This case of yours is very complex, Sir Henry.
2125988     588         When taken in conjunction with your uncle's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep.
2125989     588         But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth.
2125990     588         We may waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right."
2125991     588         We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together.
2125992     588         It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions.
2125993     588         "To go to Baskerville Hall."
2125994     588         "And when?"
2125995     588         "At the end of the week."
2125996     588         "On the whole," said Holmes,
2125997     588         "I think that your decision is a wise one.
2125998     588         I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be po
2125999     588         You did not know, Dr. Moftimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?"
2126000     588         Dr. Mortimer started violently.
2126001     588         "Followed!
2126002     588         By whom?"
2126003     588         "That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you.
2126004     588         Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Daftmoor any man with a black, full beard?"
2126005     588         "No – or, let me see – why, yes.
2126006     588         Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man with a full, black beard."
2126007     588         "Ha!
2126008     588         Where is Baffymore?"
2126009     588         "He is in charge of the Hall."
2126010     588         "We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility he might be in London."
2126011     588         "How can you do that?"
2126012     588         "Give me a telegraph form.
2126013     588         'Is all ready for Sir Henry?'
2126014     588         That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall.
2126015     588         What is the nearest telegraph-office?
2126016     588         Grimpen.
2126017     588         Very good, we will send a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen:
2126018     588         'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand.
2126019     588         If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.'
2126020     588         That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not."
2126021     588         "That's so," said Baskerville.
2126022     588         "By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?"
2126023     588         "He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead.
2126024     588         They have looked after the Hall for four generations now.
2126025     588         So far as I know, he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county."
2126026     588         "At the same time," said Baskerville, "it's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do."
2126027     588         "That is true."
2126028     588         "Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?" asked Holmes.
2126029     588         "He and his wife had five hundred pounds each."
2126030     588         "Ha!
2126031     588         Did they know that they would receive this?"
2126032     588         "Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his wlll."
2126033     588         "That is very interesting."
2126034     588         "I hope," said Dr. Mortimer, "that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me."
2126035     588         "Indeed!
2126036     588         And anyone else?"
2126037     588         "There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number of public charities.
2126038     588         The residue all went to Sir Henry."
2126039     588         "And how much was the residue?"
2126040     588         "Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds."
2126041     588         Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise.
2126042     588         "I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved," said he.
2126043     588         "Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities.
2126044     588         The total value of the estate was close on to a million."
2126045     588         "Dear me!
2126046     588         It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game.
2126047     588         And one more question, Dr. Mortimer.
2126048     588         Supposing that anything happened to our young friend here – you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis! – who would inherit the estate?"
2126049     588         "Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins.
2126050     588         James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland."
2126051     588         "Thank you.
2126052     588         These details are all of great interest.
2126053     588         Have you met Mr. James Desmond?"
2126054     588         "Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles.
2126055     588         He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life.
2126056     588         I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him."
2126057     588         "And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's thousands."
2126058     588         "He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it."
2126059     588         "And have you made your will, Sir Henry?"
2126060     588         "No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood.
2126061     588         But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate.
2126062     588         That was my poor uncle's idea.
2126063     588         How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property?
2126064     588         House, land, and dollars must go together."
2126065     588         "Quite so.
2126066     588         Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone."
2126067     588         "Dr. Mortimer returns with me."
2126068     588         "But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles away from yours.
2126069     588         With all the good will in the world he may be unable to help you.
2126070     588         No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side."
2126071     588         "Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?"
2126072     588         "If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London fo
2126073     588         At the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.
2126074     588         You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor."
2126075     588         "Whom would you recommend, then?"
2126076     588         Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.
2126077     588         "If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I."
2126078     588         The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.
2126079     588         "Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson," said he.
2126080     588         "You see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do.
2126081     588         If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never forget it."
2126082     588         The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion.
2126083     588         "I will come, with pleasure," said I. "I do not know how I could employ my time better."
2126084     588         "And you will report very carefully to me," said Holmes.
2126085     588         "When a crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act.
2126086     588         I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?"
2126087     588         "Would that suit Dr. Watson?"
2126088     588         "Perfectly."
2126089     588         "Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the ten-thirty train from Paddington."
2126090     588         We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet.
2126091     588         "My missing boot!" he cried.
2126092     588         "May all our difficulties vanish as easily!" said Sherlock Holmes.
2126093     588         "But it is a very, singular thing," Dr. Mortimer remarked.
2126094     588         "I searched this room carefully before lunch."
2126095     588         "And so did I," said Baskerville.
2126096     588         "Every, inch of it."
2126097     588         "There was certainly no boot in it then."
2126098     588         "In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching."
2126099     588         The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor could any inquiry, clear it up.
2126100     588         Another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly.
2126101     588         Setting aside the whole grim story, of Sir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, th
2126102     588         Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes cou
2126103     588         All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.
2126104     588         Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in.
2126105     588         The first ran:
2126106     588         Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.
2126107     588         The second:
2126108     588         Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to trace cut sheet of Times.
2126109     588         CARTWRlGHT.
2126110     588         "There go two of my threads, Watson.
2126111     588         There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you.
2126112     588         We must cast round for another scent."
2126113     588         "We have still the cabman who drove the spy."
2126114     588         "Exactly.
2126115     588         I haw wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question."
2126116     588         The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.
2126117     588         "I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for No. 2704," said he.
2126118     588         "I've driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint.
2126119     588         I came here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me."
2126120     588         "I have nothing in the world against you, my good man," said Holmes.
2126121     588         "On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions."
2126122     588         "Well, I've had a good day and no mistake," said the cabman with a grin.
2126123     588         "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?"
2126124     588         "First of all your name and address, in case I want you again."
2126125     588         "John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough.
2126126     588         My cab is out of Shipley's Yard, near Waterloo Station."
2126127     588         Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.
2126128     588         "Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street."
2126129     588         The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed.
2126130     588         "Why there's no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already," said he.
2126131     588         "The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone."
2126132     588         "My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.
2126133     588         You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?"
2126134     588         "Yes, he did."
2126135     588         "When did he say this?"
2126136     588         "When he left me."
2126137     588         "Did he say anything more?"
2126138     588         "He mentioned his name."
2126139     588         Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me.
2126140     588         "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?
2126141     588         That was imprudent.
2126142     588         What was the name that he mentioned?"
2126143     588         "His name," said the cabman, "was Mr. Sherlock Holmes."
2126144     588         Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman's reply.
2126145     588         For an instant he sat in silent amazement.
2126146     588         Then he burst into a hearty laugh.
2126147     588         "A touch, Watson – an undeniable touch!" said he.
2126148     588         "I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own.
2126149     588         He got home upon me very prettily that time.
2126150     588         So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?"
2126151     588         "Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name."
2126152     588         "Excellent!
2126153     588         Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred."
2126154     588         "He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square.
2126155     588         He said that he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions.
2126156     588         I was glad enough to agree.
2126157     588         First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here."
2126158     588         "This very door," said Holmes.
2126159     588         "Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about it.
2126160     588         We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.
2126161     588         Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker Street and along –"
2126162     588         "I know," said Holmes.
2126163     588         "Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go.
2126164     588         I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes.
2126165     588         Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the station.
2126166     588         Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:
2126167     588         'It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.'
2126168     588         That's how I come to know the name."
2126169     588         "I see.
2126170     588         And you saw no more of him?"
2126171     588         "Not after he went into the station."
2126172     588         "And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
2126173     588         The cabman scratched his head.
2126174     588         "Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe.
2126175     588         I'd put him at forty years of age, and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir.
2126176     588         He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face.
2126177     588         I don't know as I could say more than that."
2126178     588         "Colour of his eyes?"
2126179     588         "No, I can't say that."
2126180     588         "Nothing more that you can remember?"
2126181     588         "No, sir; nothing."
2126182     588         "Well, then, here is your half-sovereign.
2126183     588         There's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information.
2126184     588         Good-night!"
2126185     588         "Good-night, sir, and thank you!"
2126186     588         John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.
2126187     588         "Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began," said he.
2126188     588         "The cunning rascal!
2126189     588         He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message.
2126190     588         I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel.
2126191     588         I've been checkmated in London.
2126192     588         I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire.
2126193     588         But I'm not easy in my mind about it."
2126194     588         "About what?"
2126195     588         "About sending you.
2126196     588         It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.
2126197     588         Yes my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more."
2126198     588         Chapter 6 – Baskerville Hall
2126199     588         Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire.
2126200     588         Mr. Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice.
2126201     588         "I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing."
2126202     588         "What sort of facts?" I asked.
2126203     588         "Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.
2126204     588         I have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results have, I fear, been negative.
2126205     588         One thing only appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him.
2126206     588         I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations.
2126207     588         There remain the people who will actually surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor."
2126208     588         "Would it not be well in the first place to get rid ofl this Barrymore couple?"
2126209     588         "By no means.
2126210     588         You could not make a greater mistake.
2126211     588         If they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them.
2126212     588         No, no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects.
2126213     588         Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we know nothing.
2126214     588         There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.
2126215     588         There is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor. and there are one or two other neighbours.
2126216     588         These are the folk who must be your very special study."
2126217     588         "I will do my best."
2126218     588         "You have arms, I suppose?"
2126219     588         "Yes, I thought it as well to take them."
2126220     588         "Most certainly.
2126221     588         Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never relax your precautions."
2126222     588         Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform.
2126223     588         "No, we have no news of any kind," said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my friend's questions.
2126224     588         "I can swear to one thing, and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days.
2126225     588         We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our notice."
2126226     588         "You have always kept together, I presume?"
2126227     588         "Except yesterday afternoon.
2126228     588         I usually give up one day to pure amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of Surgeons."
2126229     588         "And I went to look at the folk in the park," said Baskerville.
2126230     588         "But we had no trouble of any kind."
2126231     588         "It was imprudent, all the same," said Holmes, shaking his head and looking very grave.
2126232     588         "I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do.
2126233     588         Did you get your other boot?"
2126234     588         "No, sir, it is gone forever."
2126235     588         "Indeed.
2126236     588         That is very interesting.
2126237     588         Well, good-bye," he added as the train began to glide down the platform.
2126238     588         "Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted."
2126239     588         I looked back at the plafform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.
2126240     588         The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with Dr. Mortimer's spaniel.
2126241     588         In a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate.
2126242     588         Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familar features of the Devon scenery.
2126243     588         "I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson," said he; "but I have never seen a place to compare with it."
2126244     588         "l never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county," I remarked.
2126245     588         "It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county," said Dr. Mortimer.
2126246     588         "A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment.
2126247     588         Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics.
2126248     588         But you were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?"
2126249     588         "I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and had never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast.
2126250     588         Thence I went straight to a friend in America.
2126251     588         I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the moor."
2126252     588         "Are you?
2126253     588         Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first sight of the moor," said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window.
2126254     588         Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream.
2126255     588         Baskerville sat for a long time his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep.
2126256     588         There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and mas
2126257     588         There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes.
2126258     588         If on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it.
2126259     588         The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.
2126260     588         Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting.
2126261     588         Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage.
2126262     588         It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed.
2126263     588         The coachman, a hardfaced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.
2126264     588         Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, 
2126265     588         The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns.
2126266     588         Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun.
2126267     588         Still steadily rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders.
2126268     588         Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir.
2126269     588         At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions.
2126270     588         To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.
2126271     588         Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed.
2126272     588         The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation – sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.
2126273     588         "Halloa!" cried Dr. Mortimer, "what is this?"
2126274     588         A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in front of us.
2126275     588         On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm.
2126276     588         He was watching the road along which we travelled.
2126277     588         "What is this, Perkins?" asked Dr. Mortimer.
2126278     588         Our driver half turned in his seat.
2126279     588         "There's a convict escaped from Princetown, sir.
2126280     588         He's been out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every station, but they've had no sight of him yet.
2126281     588         The farmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact."
2126282     588         "Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give information."
2126283     588         "Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut.
2126284     588         You see, it isn't like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing."
2126285     588         "Who is he, then?"
2126286     588         "It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer."
2126287     588         I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin.
2126288     588         The commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct.
2126289     588         Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and craggy caims and tors.
2126290     588         A cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering.
2126291     588         Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.
2126292     588         It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.
2126293     588         Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.
2126294     588         We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us.
2126295     588         We looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands.
2126296     588         The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders.
2126297     588         Now and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline.
2126298     588         Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and fus which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm.
2126299     588         Two high, narrow towers rose over the trees.
2126300     588         The driver pointed with his whip.
2126301     588         "Baskerville Hall," said he.
2126302     588         Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes.
2126303     588         A few minutes later we had reached the lodgegates, a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and summounted by the boars' heads of the Baskervilles.
2126304     588         The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles's South African gold.
2126305     588         Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel.over our heads.
2126306     588         Baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end.
2126307     588         "Was it here?" he asked in a low voice.
2126308     588         "No, no, the yew alley is on the other side."
2126309     588         The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.
2126310     588         "It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this," said he.
2126311     588         "It's enough to scare any man.
2126312     588         I'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front of the hall door."
2126313     588         The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before us.
2126314     588         In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected.
2126315     588         The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil.
2126316     588         From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenellated, and pierced with many loopholes.
2126317     588         To right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.
2126318     588         A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.
2126319     588         "Welcome, Sir Henry!
2126320     588         Welcome to Baskerville Hall!"
2126321     588         A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette.
2126322     588         The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall.
2126323     588         She came out and helped the man to hand down our bags.
2126324     588         "You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?" said Dr. Mortimer.
2126325     588         "My wife is expecting me."
2126326     588         "Surely you will stay and have some dinner?"
2126327     588         "No, I must go.
2126328     588         I shall probably find some work awaiting me.
2126329     588         I would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide than I.
2126330     588         Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of service."
2126331     588         The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us.
2126332     588         It was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak.
2126333     588         In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped.
2126334     588         Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive.
2126335     588         Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats of arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.
2126336     588         "It's just as I imagined it," said Sir Henry.
2126337     588         "Is it not the very picture of an old family home?
2126338     588         To think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.
2126339     588         It strikes me solemn to think of it."
2126340     588         I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him.
2126341     588         The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him.
2126342     588         Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant.
2126343     588         He was a remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished features.
2126344     588         "Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?"
2126345     588         "Is it ready?"
2126346     588         "In a very few minutes, sir.
2126347     588         You will find hot water in your rooms.
2126348     588         My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff."
2126349     588         "What new conditions?"
2126350     588         "I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have more company, and so you will need changes in your household."
2126351     588         "Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?"
2126352     588         "Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir."
2126353     588         "But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not?
2126354     588         I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection."
2126355     588         I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.
2126356     588         "I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife.
2126357     588         But to tell the truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us.
2126358     588         I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall."
2126359     588         "But what do you intend to do?"
2126360     588         "I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business.
2126361     588         Sir Charles's generosity has given us the means to do so.
2126362     588         And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms."
2126363     588         A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall, approached by a double stair.
2126364     588         From this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms opened.
2126365     588         My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next door to it.
2126366     588         These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.
2126367     588         But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and gloom.
2126368     588         It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents.
2126369     588         At one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it.
2126370     588         Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them.
2126371     588         With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two blackclothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and 
2126372     588         A dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company.
2126373     588         We talked little, and I for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.
2126374     588         "My word, it isn't a very cheerful place," said Sir Henry.
2126375     588         "I suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present.
2126376     588         I don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this.
2126377     588         However, if it suits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning."
2126378     588         I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my window.
2126379     588         It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door.
2126380     588         Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind.
2126381     588         A half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds.
2126382     588         In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor.
2126383     588         I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest.
2126384     588         And yet it was not quite the last.
2126385     588         I found myself weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not come.
2126386     588         Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house.
2126387     588         And then suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable.
2126388     588         It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.
2126389     588         I sat up in bed and listened intently.
2126390     588         The noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house.
2126391     588         For half an hour I waited with every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.
2126392     588         Chapter 7 – The Stapletons of Merripit House
2126393     588         The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall.
2126394     588         As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them.
2126395     588         The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.
2126396     588         "I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!" said the baronet.
2126397     588         "We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive, so we took a gray view of the place.
2126398     588         Now we are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more."
2126399     588         "And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination," I answered.
2126400     588         "Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in the night?"
2126401     588         "That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort.
2126402     588         I waited quite a time, but there was no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream."
2126403     588         "I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman."
2126404     588         "We must ask about this right away."
2126405     588         He rang the bell and asked Barrymore whether he could account for our experience.
2126406     588         It seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master's question.
2126407     588         "There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry," he answered.
2126408     588         "One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her."
2126409     588         And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face.
2126410     588         She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression of mouth.
2126411     588         But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids.
2126412     588         It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must know it.
2126413     588         Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so.
2126414     588         Why had he done this?
2126415     588         And why did she weep so bitterly?
2126416     588         Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom.
2126417     588         It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's death.
2126418     588         Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in the cab in Regent Street?
2126419     588         The beard might well have been the same.
2126420     588         The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might easily have been erroneous.
2126421     588         How could I settle the point forever?
2126422     588         Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore's own hands.
2126423     588         Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock Holmes.
2126424     588         Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the time was propitious for my excursion.
2126425     588         It was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest.
2126426     588         The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the telegram.
2126427     588         "Certainly, sir," said he, "I had the telegram delivered to Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed."
2126428     588         "Who delivered it?"
2126429     588         "My boy here.
2126430     588         James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the Hall last week, did you not?"
2126431     588         "Yes, father, I delivered it."
2126432     588         "Into his own hands?" I asked.
2126433     588         "Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she promised to deliver it at once."
2126434     588         "Did you see Mr. Barrymore?"
2126435     588         "No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft."
2126436     588         "If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?"
2126437     588         "Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is," said the postmaster testily.
2126438     588         "Didn't he get the telegram?
2126439     588         If there is any mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain."
2126440     588         It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not been in London all the time.
2126441     588         Suppose that it were so – suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to England.
2126442     588         What then?
2126443     588         Was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own?
2126444     588         What interest could he have in persecuting the Baskerville family?
2126445     588         I thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times.
2126446     588         Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?
2126447     588         The only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores.
2126448     588         But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet.
2126449     588         Holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations.
2126450     588         I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.
2126451     588         Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name.
2126452     588         I turned, expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a 
2126453     588         A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.
2126454     588         "You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson," said he as he came panting up to where I stood.
2126455     588         "Here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions.
2126456     588         You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer.
2126457     588         I am Stapleton, of Merripit House."
2126458     588         "Your net and box would have told me as much," said I, "for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist.
2126459     588         But how did you know me?"
2126460     588         "I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed.
2126461     588         As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself.
2126462     588         I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his journey?"
2126463     588         "He is very well, thank you."
2126464     588         "We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here.
2126465     588         It is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside.
2126466     588         Sir Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?"
2126467     588         "I do not think that it is likely."
2126468     588         "Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?"
2126469     588         "I have heard it."
2126470     588         "It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!
2126471     588         Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor."
2126472     588         He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously.
2126473     588         "The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end."
2126474     588         "But how?"
2126475     588         "His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart.
2126476     588         I fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley.
2126477     588         I feared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was weak."
2126478     588         "How did you know that?"
2126479     588         "My friend Mortimer told me."
2126480     588         "You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of fright in consequence?"
2126481     588         "Have you any better explanation?"
2126482     588         "I have not come to any conclusion."
2126483     588         "Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
2126484     588         The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended.
2126485     588         "It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr Watson," said he.
2126486     588         "The records of your detective have reached us here, and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself.
2126487     588         When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity.
2126488     588         If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take."
2126489     588         "I am afraid that I cannot answer that question."
2126490     588         "May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himsel?"
2126491     588         "He cannot leave town at present.
2126492     588         He has other cases which engage his attention."
2126493     588         "What a pity!
2126494     588         He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.
2126495     588         But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will command me.
2126496     588         If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice."
2126497     588         "I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind."
2126498     588         "Excellent!" said Stapleton.
2126499     588         "You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet.
2126500     588         I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again."
2126501     588         We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor.
2126502     588         A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
2126503     588         The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing in its niches.
2126504     588         From over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke.
2126505     588         "A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House," said he.
2126506     588         "Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister."
2126507     588         My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered.
2126508     588         It was certain that I could not help with those.
2126509     588         And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor.
2126510     588         I accepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.
2126511     588         "It is a wonderful place, the moor," said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges.
2126512     588         "You never tire of the moor.
2126513     588         You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious."
2126514     588         "You know it well, then?"
2126515     588         "I have only been here two years.
2126516     588         The residents would call me a newcomer.
2126517     588         We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do."
2126518     588         "Is it hard to know?"
2126519     588         "Very hard.
2126520     588         You see, for example, this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it.
2126521     588         Do you observe anything remarkable about that?"
2126522     588         "It would be a rare place for a gallop."
2126523     588         "You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now.
2126524     588         You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?"
2126525     588         "Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest."
2126526     588         Stapleton laughed.
2126527     588         "That is the great Grimpen Mire," said he.
2126528     588         "A false step yonder means death to man or beast.
2126529     588         Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out.
2126530     588         I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last.
2126531     588         Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful place.
2126532     588         And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive.
2126533     588         By George, there is another of those miserable ponies!"
2126534     588         Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.
2126535     588         Then a long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor.
2126536     588         It turned me cold with horror, but my companion's nerves seemed to be stronger than mme.
2126537     588         "It's gone!" said he.
2126538     588         "The mire has him.
2126539     588         Two in two days, and many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches.
2126540     588         It's a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire."
2126541     588         "And you say you can penetrate it?"
2126542     588         "Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take.
2126543     588         I have found them out."
2126544     588         "But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?"
2126545     588         "Well, you see the hills beyond?
2126546     588         They are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course of years.
2126547     588         That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them."
2126548     588         "I shall try my luck some day."
2126549     588         He looked at me with a surprised face.
2126550     588         "For God's sake put such an idea out of your mind," said he.
2126551     588         "Your blood would be upon my head.
2126552     588         I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.
2126553     588         It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it."
2126554     588         "Halloa!" I cried.
2126555     588         "What is that?"
2126556     588         A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor.
2126557     588         It filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came.
2126558     588         From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.
2126559     588         Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.
2126560     588         "Queer place, the moor!" said he.
2126561     588         "But what is it?"
2126562     588         "The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey.
2126563     588         I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud."
2126564     588         I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes.
2126565     588         Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind us.
2126566     588         "You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?" said I.
2126567     588         "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?"
2126568     588         "Bogs make queer noises sometimes.
2126569     588         It's the mud settling, or the water rising, or something."
2126570     588         "No, no, that was a living voice."
2126571     588         "Well, perhaps it was.
2126572     588         Did you ever hear a bittern booming?"
2126573     588         "No, I never did."
2126574     588         "It's a very rare bird – practically extinct – in England now, but all things are possible upon the moor.
2126575     588         Yes, I should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns."
2126576     588         "It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life."
2126577     588         "Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether.
2126578     588         Look at the hillside yonder.
2126579     588         What do you make of those?"
2126580     588         The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a score of them at least.
2126581     588         "What are they?
2126582     588         Sheep-pens?"
2126583     588         "No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors.
2126584     588         Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them.
2126585     588         These are his wigwams with the roofs off.
2126586     588         You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside.
2126587     588         "But it is quite a town.
2126588     588         When was it inhabited?"
2126589     588         "Neolithic man – no date."
2126590     588         "What did he do?"
2126591     588         "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe.
2126592     588         Look at the great trench in the opposite hill.
2126593     588         That is his mark.
2126594     588         Yes, you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson.
2126595     588         Oh, excuse me an instant!
2126596     588         It is surely Cyclopides."
2126597     588         A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it.
2126598     588         To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air.
2126599     588         His gray clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.
2126600     588         I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round, found a woman near me upon the path.
2126601     588         She had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.
2126602     588         I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
2126603     588         The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.
2126604     588         There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England – slim, elegant, and tall.
2126605     588         She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes.
2126606     588         With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path.
2126607     588         Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me.
2126608     588         I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.
2126609     588         "Go back!" she said.
2126610     588         "Go straight back to London, instantly."
2126611     588         I could only stare at her in stupid surprise.
2126612     588         Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.
2126613     588         "Why should I go back?" I asked.
2126614     588         "I cannot explain."
2126615     588         She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance.
2126616     588         "But for God's sake do what I ask you.
2126617     588         Go back and never set foot upon the moor again."
2126618     588         "But I have only just come."
2126619     588         "Man, man!" she cried. "Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good?
2126620     588         Go back to London!
2126621     588         Start to-night!
2126622     588         Get away from this place at all costs!
2126623     588         Hush, my brother is coming!
2126624     588         Not a word of what I have said.
2126625     588         Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder?
2126626     588         We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place."
2126627     588         Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.
2126628     588         "Halloa, Beryl!" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.
2126629     588         "Well, Jack, you are very hot."
2126630     588         "Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides.
2126631     588         He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn.
2126632     588         What a pity that I should have missed him!"
2126633     588         He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me.
2126634     588         "You have introduced yourselves, I can see."
2126635     588         "Yes.
2126636     588         I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor."
2126637     588         "Why, who do you think this is?"
2126638     588         "I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville."
2126639     588         "No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is Dr. Watson."
2126640     588         A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face.
2126641     588         "We have been talking at cross purposes," said she.
2126642     588         "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes.
2126643     588         "I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor," said she.
2126644     588         "It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids.
2126645     588         But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?"
2126646     588         A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling.
2126647     588         An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy.
2126648     588         We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house.
2126649     588         Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady.
2126650     588         As I looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.
2126651     588         "Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to my thought.
2126652     588         "And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?"
2126653     588         "Quite happy," said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.
2126654     588         "I had a school," said Stapleton. "It was in the north country.
2126655     588         The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear to me.
2126656     588         However, the fates were against us.
2126657     588         A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died.
2126658     588         It never recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up.
2126659     588         And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am
2126660     588         All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."
2126661     588         "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull – less for you, perhaps, than for your sister."
2126662     588         "No, no, I am never dull," said she quickly.
2126663     588         "We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.
2126664     588         Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.
2126665     588         Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion.
2126666     588         We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell.
2126667     588         Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?"
2126668     588         "I am sure that he would be delighted."
2126669     588         "Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so.
2126670     588         We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings.
2126671     588         Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera?
2126672     588         I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of England.
2126673     588         By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready."
2126674     588         But I was eager to get back to my charge.
2126675     588         The melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness.
2126676     588         Then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it.
2126677     588         I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.
2126678     588         It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track.
2126679     588         Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side.
2126680     588         "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," said she.
2126681     588         "I had not even time to put on my hat.
2126682     588         I must not stop, or my brother may miss me.
2126683     588         I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry.
2126684     588         Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."
2126685     588         "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I.
2126686     588         "I am Sir Henry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.
2126687     588         Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London."
2126688     588         "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson.
2126689     588         When you know me better you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do."
2126690     588         "No, no.
2126691     588         I remember the thrill in your voice. I remembe the look in your eyes.
2126692     588         Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.
2126693     588         Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track.
2126694     588         Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."
2126695     588         An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.
2126696     588         "You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she.
2126697     588         "My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles.
2126698     588         We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house.
2126699     588         He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed.
2126700     588         I was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run.
2126701     588         That was all which I intended to convey.
2126702     588         "But what is the danger?"
2126703     588         "You know the story of the hound?"
2126704     588         "I do not believe in such nonsense."
2126705     588         "But I do.
2126706     588         If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family.
2126707     588         The world is wide.
2126708     588         Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?"
2126709     588         "Because it is the place of danger.
2126710     588         That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move."
2126711     588         "I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite."
2126712     588         "I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton.
2126713     588         If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said?
2126714     588         There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object."
2126715     588         "My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor.
2126716     588         He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away.
2126717     588         But I have done my duty now and I will say no more.
2126718     588         I must go back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you.
2126719     588         Good-bye!"
2126720     588         She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.
2126721     588         Chapter 8 – First Report of Dr. Watson
2126722     588         From this point onward I will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the table.
2126723     588         One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do.
2126724     588         Baskerville Hall, October 13th.
2126725     588         My dear Holmes:
2126726     588         My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world.
2126727     588         The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm.
2126728     588         When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people.
2126729     588         On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples.
2126730     588         As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you wouid feel that hi
2126731     588         The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil.
2126732     588         I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.
2126733     588         All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.
2126734     588         I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun.
2126735     588         Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.
2126736     588         If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to to-day there was nothing of importance to relate.
2126737     588         Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation.
2126738     588         One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor.
2126739     588         There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district.
2126740     588         A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him.
2126741     588         It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time.
2126742     588         Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all.
2126743     588         Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place.
2126744     588         But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep.
2126745     588         We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.
2126746     588         We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons.
2126747     588         They live miles from any help.
2126748     588         There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man.
2126749     588         They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance.
2126750     588         Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.
2126751     588         The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour.
2126752     588         It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman.
2126753     588         There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.
2126754     588         Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires.
2126755     588         He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said.
2126756     588         I trust that he is kind to her.
2126757     588         There is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature.
2126758     588         You would find him an interesting study.
2126759     588         He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin.
2126760     588         It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story.
2126761     588         We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass.
2126762     588         In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast.
2126763     588         In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy.
2126764     588         Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men.
2126765     588         He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.
2126766     588         Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet.
2126767     588         He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.
2126768     588         On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.
2126769     588         From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual.
2126770     588         He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister.
2126771     588         They dine here to-night, and there is some talk of our going to them next week.
2126772     588         One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.
2126773     588         He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage.
2126774     588         Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tete-a-tete.
2126775     588         By the way, your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties.
2126776     588         My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.
2126777     588         The other day – Thursday, to be more exact – Dr. Mortimer lunched with us.
2126778     588         He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy.
2126779     588         Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he!
2126780     588         The Stapletons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry's request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night.
2126781     588         It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side.
2126782     588         At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house.
2126783     588         Halfway down is the moorgate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash.
2126784     588         It is a white wooden gate with a latch.
2126785     588         Beyond it lies the wide moor.
2126786     588         I remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred.
2126787     588         As the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion.
2126788     588         There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled.
2126789     588         And from what?
2126790     588         A sheep-dog of the moor?
2126791     588         Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and monstrous?
2126792     588         Was there a human agency in the matter?
2126793     588         Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say?
2126794     588         It was all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.
2126795     588         One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.
2126796     588         He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric.
2126797     588         His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation.
2126798     588         He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement.
2126799     588         Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it.
2126800     588         At others he will with his own hands tear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass.
2126801     588         He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in ef
2126802     588         He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future.
2126803     588         Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I should send some description of the people who surround us.
2126804     588         He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict.
2126805     588         If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down.
2126806     588         He helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.
2126807     588         And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development o
2126808     588         First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here.
2126809     588         I have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other.
2126810     588         I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself.
2126811     588         Barrymore said that he had.
2126812     588         "Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?" asked Sir Henry.
2126813     588         Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.
2126814     588         "No," said he,
2126815     588         "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it up to me."
2126816     588         "Did you answer it yourself?"
2126817     588         "No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it."
2126818     588         In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.
2126819     588         "I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning, Sir Henry," said he.
2126820     588         "I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?"
2126821     588         Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now all arrived.
2126822     588         Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me.
2126823     588         She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical.
2126824     588         You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.
2126825     588         Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face.
2126826     588         Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart.
2126827     588         Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant.
2126828     588         I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.
2126829     588         And yet it may seem a small matter in itself.
2126830     588         You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever.
2126831     588         Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room.
2126832     588         I rose, opened my door, and peeped out.
2126833     588         A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor.
2126834     588         It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand.
2126835     588         He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet.
2126836     588         I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore.
2126837     588         He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.
2126838     588         I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side.
2126839     588         I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him.
2126840     588         When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms.
2126841     588         Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever.
2126842     588         The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless.
2126843     588         I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door.
2126844     588         Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass.
2126845     588         His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.
2126846     588         For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light.
2126847     588         Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey.
2126848     588         Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came.
2126849     588         What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of.
2126850     588         I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts.
2126851     588         I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night.
2126852     588         I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.
2126853     588         Chapter 9 – Second Report of Dr. Watson THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.
2126854     588         MY DEAR HOLMES:
2126855     588         If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us.
2126856     588         In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you.
2126857     588         Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated.
2126858     588         In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated.
2126859     588         But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.
2126860     588         Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the-night before.
2126861     588         The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house – it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor.
2126862     588         There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained.
2126863     588         It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor.
2126864     588         The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.
2126865     588         It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot.
2126866     588         That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife.
2126867     588         The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it.
2126868     588         That opening of the door whlch I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment.
2126869     588         So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.
2126870     588         But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear.
2126871     588         I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen.
2126872     588         He was less surprised than I had expected.
2126873     588         "I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it," said he.
2126874     588         "Two or three times I have heard hls steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name."
2126875     588         "Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window," I suggested.
2126876     588         "Perhaps he does.
2126877     588         If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after.
2126878     588         I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here."
2126879     588         "I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest," said I.
2126880     588         "He would follow Barrymore and see what he did."
2126881     588         "Then we shall do it together."
2126882     588         "But surely he would hear us."
2126883     588         "The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that.
2126884     588         We'll sit up in my room to-night and wait until he passes."
2126885     588         Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.
2126886     588         The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon.
2126887     588         There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family.
2126888     588         When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete.
2126889     588         Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.
2126890     588         And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect.
2126891     588         To-day, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.
2126892     588         After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out.
2126893     588         As a matter of course I did the same.
2126894     588         "What, are you coming, Watson?" he asked, looking at me in a curious way.
2126895     588         "That depends on whether you are going on the moor," said I.
2126896     588         "Yes, I am."
2126897     588         "Well, you know what my instructions are.
2126898     588         I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor."
2126899     588         Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.
2126900     588         "My dear fellow," said he, "Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor.
2126901     588         You understand me?
2126902     588         I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport.
2126903     588         I must go out alone."
2126904     588         It put me in a most awkward position.
2126905     588         I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone.
2126906     588         But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight.
2126907     588         I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions.
2126908     588         I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought.
2126909     588         It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House.
2126910     588         I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off.
2126911     588         There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view – the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry.
2126912     588         Thence I saw him at once.
2126913     588         He was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton.
2126914     588         It was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment.
2126915     588         They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent.
2126916     588         I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next.
2126917     588         To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight.
2126918     588         To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task.
2126919     588         Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done.
2126920     588         It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.
2126921     588         Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview.
2126922     588         A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground.
2126923     588         It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net.
2126924     588         He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction.
2126925     588         At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted.
2126926     588         He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest.
2126927     588         Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round.
2126928     588         Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him.
2126929     588         He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.
2126930     588         What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them.
2126931     588         The lady stood by in haughty silence.
2126932     588         Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother.
2126933     588         The naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure.
2126934     588         The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection. What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a s
2126935     588         I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom.
2126936     588         His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do.
2126937     588         "Halloa, Watson!
2126938     588         Where have you dropped from?" said he.
2126939     588         "You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?"
2126940     588         I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred.
2126941     588         For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.
2126942     588         "You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private," said he, "but, by thunder, the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing – and a mighty poor wooing at that!
2126943     588         Where had you engaged a seat?"
2126944     588         "I was on that hill."
2126945     588         "Quite in the back row, eh?
2126946     588         But her brother was well up to the front.
2126947     588         Did you see him come out on us?"
2126948     588         "Yes, I did."
2126949     588         "Did he ever strike you as being crazy – this brother of hers?"
2126950     588         "I can't say that he ever did."
2126951     588         "I dare say not.
2126952     588         I always thought him sane enough until to-day, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.
2126953     588         What's the matter with me, anyhow?
2126954     588         You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson.
2126955     588         Tell me straight, now!
2126956     588         Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?"
2126957     588         "I should say not."
2126958     588         "He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on.
2126959     588         What has he against me?
2126960     588         I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of.
2126961     588         And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers."
2126962     588         "Did he say so?"
2126963     588         "That, and a deal more.
2126964     588         I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too – she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear.
2126965     588         There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words.
2126966     588         But he has never let us get together and it was only to-day for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone.
2126967     588         She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it.
2126968     588         She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it.
2126969     588         I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me.
2126970     588         With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman.
2126971     588         He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury.
2126972     588         What was I doing with the lady?
2126973     588         How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?
2126974     588         Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked?
2126975     588         If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him.
2126976     588         As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife.
2126977     588         That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by.
2126978     588         So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county.
2126979     588         Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay."
2126980     588         I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself.
2126981     588         Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family.
2126982     588         That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing.
2126983     588         However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon.
2126984     588         He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a 
2126985     588         "l don't say now that he isn't a crazy man," said Sir Henry "I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done."
2126986     588         "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?"
2126987     588         "His sister is everything in his life, he says.
2126988     588         That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value.
2126989     588         They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him.
2126990     588         He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did
2126991     588         He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life.
2126992     588         If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else.
2126993     588         But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it.
2126994     588         He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love.
2126995     588         This I promised, and so the matter rests."
2126996     588         So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up.
2126997     588         It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.
2126998     588         We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor – even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry.
2126999     588         And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.
2127000     588         Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an agent – that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down.
2127001     588         All these things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.
2127002     588         I have said "by one night's work," but, in truth, it was by two nights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank.
2127003     588         I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs.
2127004     588         It was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs.
2127005     588         Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again.
2127006     588         The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound.
2127007     588         It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander.
2127008     588         One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more.
2127009     588         We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.
2127010     588         Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance.
2127011     588         Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit.
2127012     588         Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness.
2127013     588         Softly we stole along untii we had come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage.
2127014     588         Then he passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor.
2127015     588         We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it.
2127016     588         We had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread.
2127017     588         Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing.
2127018     588         When at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights before.
2127019     588         We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural.
2127020     588         He walked into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us.
2127021     588         His dark eyes, glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.
2127022     588         "What are you doing here, Barrymore?"
2127023     588         "Nothing, sir."
2127024     588         His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle.
2127025     588         "It was the window, sir.
2127026     588         I go round at night to see that they are fastened."
2127027     588         "On the second floor?"
2127028     588         "Yes, sir, all the windows."
2127029     588         "Look here, Barrymore," said Sir Henry sternly, "we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later.
2127030     588         Come, now! No lies!
2127031     588         What were you doing at that window??'
2127032     588         The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.
2127033     588         "I was doing no harm, sir.
2127034     588         I was holding a candle to the window."
2127035     588         "And why were you holding a candle to the window?"
2127036     588         "Don't ask me, Sir Henry – don't ask me!
2127037     588         I give you my word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it.
2127038     588         If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you."
2127039     588         A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler.
2127040     588         "He must have been holding it as a signal," said I.
2127041     588         "Let us see if there is any answer."
2127042     588         I held it as he had done, and stared out into the darkness of the night.
2127043     588         Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds.
2127044     588         And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window.
2127045     588         "There it is!" I cried.
2127046     588         "No, no, sir, it is nothing – nothing at all!" the butler broke in;
2127047     588         "I assure you, sir –"
2127048     588         "Move your light across the window, Watson!" cried the baronet.
2127049     588         "See, the other moves also!
2127050     588         Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
2127051     588         Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this conspiracy that is going on?"
2127052     588         The man's face became openly defiant.
2127053     588         "It is my business, and not yours.
2127054     588         I will not tell."
2127055     588         "Then you leave my employment right away."
2127056     588         "Very good, sir.
2127057     588         If I must I must."
2127058     588         "And you go in disgrace.
2127059     588         By thunder, you may well be ashamed of yourself.
2127060     588         Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me."
2127061     588         "No, no, sir; no, not against you!"
2127062     588         It was a woman's voice, and Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing at the door.
2127063     588         Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.
2127064     588         "We have to go, Eliza.
2127065     588         This is the end of it.
2127066     588         You can pack our things," said the butler.
2127067     588         "Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this?
2127068     588         It is my doing, Sir Henry – all mine.
2127069     588         He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him."
2127070     588         "Speak out, then!
2127071     588         What does it mean?"
2127072     588         "My unhappy brother is starving on the moor.
2127073     588         We cannot let him perish at our very gates.
2127074     588         The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it."
2127075     588         "Then your brother is –"
2127076     588         "The escaped convict, sir – Selden, the criminal."
2127077     588         "That's the truth, sir," said Barrymore.
2127078     588         "I said that it was not my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you."
2127079     588         This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window.
2127080     588         Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in amazement.
2127081     588         Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?
2127082     588         "Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother.
2127083     588         We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it.
2127084     588         Then as he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt.
2127085     588         From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister would.
2127086     588         That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could not refuse to help him.
2127087     588         When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do?
2127088     588         We took him in and fed him and cared for him.
2127089     588         Then you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there.
2127090     588         But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him.
2127091     588         Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert him.
2127092     588         That is the whole truth, as I am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake he has done all that he has."
2127093     588         The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them.
2127094     588         "Is this true, Barrymore?"
2127095     588         "Yes, Sir Henry.
2127096     588         Every word of it."
2127097     588         "Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife.
2127098     588         Forget what I have said.
2127099     588         Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning."
2127100     588         When they were gone we looked out of the window again.
2127101     588         Sir Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces.
2127102     588         Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light.
2127103     588         "I wonder he dares," said Sir Henry.
2127104     588         "It may be so placed as to be only visible from here."
2127105     588         "Very likely.
2127106     588         How far do you think it is?"
2127107     588         "Out by the Cleft Tor, I think."
2127108     588         "Not more than a mile or two off."
2127109     588         "Hardly that."
2127110     588         "Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.
2127111     588         And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle.
2127112     588         By thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!"
2127113     588         The same thought had crossed my own mind.
2127114     588         It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been forced from them.
2127115     588         The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.
2127116     588         We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm.
2127117     588         With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adve
2127118     588         "I will come," said I.
2127119     588         "Then get your revolver and put on your boots.
2127120     588         The sooner we start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off."
2127121     588         In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves.
2127122     588         The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay.
2127123     588         Now and again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall.
2127124     588         The light still burned steadily in front.
2127125     588         "Are you armed?" I asked.
2127126     588         "I have a hunting-crop."
2127127     588         "We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist."
2127128     588         "I say, Watson," said the baronet, "what would Holmes say to this?
2127129     588         How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?"
2127130     588         As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire.
2127131     588         It came with the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away.
2127132     588         Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing.
2127133     588         The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.
2127134     588         "My God, what's that, Watson?"
2127135     588         "I don't know.
2127136     588         It's a sound they have on the moor.
2127137     588         I heard it once before."
2127138     588         It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us.
2127139     588         We stood straining our ears, but nothing came.
2127140     588         "Watson," said the baronet, "it was the cry of a hound."
2127141     588         My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.
2127142     588         "What do they call this sound?" he asked.
2127143     588         "Who?"
2127144     588         "The folk on the countryside."
2127145     588         "Oh, they are ignorant people.
2127146     588         Why should you mind what they call it?"
2127147     588         "Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?"
2127148     588         I hesitated but could not escape the question.
2127149     588         "They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles."
2127150     588         He groaned and was silent for a few moments.
2127151     588         "A hound it was," he said at last, "but it seemed to come from miles away, over yonder, I think."
2127152     588         "It was hard to say whence it came."
2127153     588         "It rose and fell with the wind.
2127154     588         Isn't that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire?"
2127155     588         "Yes, it is."
2127156     588         "Well, it was up there.
2127157     588         Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound?
2127158     588         I am not a child.
2127159     588         You need not fear to speak the truth."
2127160     588         "Stapleton was with me when I heard it last.
2127161     588         He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird."
2127162     588         "No, no, it was a hound.
2127163     588         My God, can there be some truth in all these stories?
2127164     588         Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?
2127165     588         You don't believe it, do you, Watson?"
2127166     588         "No, no."
2127167     588         "And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that.
2127168     588         And my uncle!
2127169     588         There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay.
2127170     588         It all fits together.
2127171     588         I don't think that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood.
2127172     588         Feel my hand!"
2127173     588         It was as cold as a block of marble.
2127174     588         "You'll be all right to-morrow."
2127175     588         "I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head.
2127176     588         What do you advise that we do now?"
2127177     588         "Shall we turn back?"
2127178     588         "No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it.
2127179     588         We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us.
2127180     588         Come on!
2127181     588         We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor."
2127182     588         We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front.
2127183     588         There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.
2127184     588         But at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.
2127185     588         A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall.
2127186     588         A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light.
2127187     588         It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near it – just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.
2127188     588         "What shall we do now?" whispered Sir Henry.
2127189     588         "Wait here.
2127190     588         He must be near his light.
2127191     588         Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him."
2127192     588         The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him.
2127193     588         Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with vile passions.
2127194     588         Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides.
2127195     588         The light beneath him was reflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters.
2127196     588         Something had evidently aroused his suspicions.
2127197     588         It may have been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face.
2127198     588         Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness.
2127199     588         I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.
2127200     588         At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us.
2127201     588         I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run.
2127202     588         At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.
2127203     588         We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat.
2127204     588         A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.
2127205     588         We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him.
2127206     588         We saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill.
2127207     588         We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.
2127208     588         Finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the distance.
2127209     588         And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected thing.
2127210     588         We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase.
2127211     588         The moon was low upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc.
2127212     588         There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor.
2127213     588         Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes.
2127214     588         I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly.
2127215     588         As far as I could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man.
2127216     588         He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him.
2127217     588         He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.
2127218     588         It was not the convict.
2127219     588         This man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man.
2127220     588         With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone.
2127221     588         There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.
2127222     588         I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some distance away. The baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures.
2127223     588         He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me.
2127224     588         "A warder, no doubl," said he.
2127225     588         "The moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped."
2127226     588         Well, perhaps his explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of it.
2127227     588         To-day we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner.
2127228     588         Such are the adventures of last night, and you must acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in the matter of a report.
2127229     588         Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusilons.
2127230     588         We are certainly making some progress.
2127231     588         So far as the Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation very much.
2127232     588         But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever.
2127233     588         Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon this also.
2127234     588         Best of all would it be if you could come down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days.
2127235     588         Chapter 10 – Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
2127236     588         So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes.
2127237     588         Now, however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time.
2127238     588         A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory.
2127239     588         I proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.
2127240     588         October 16th.
2127241     588         A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.
2127242     588         The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces.
2127243     588         It is melancholy outside and in.
2127244     588         The baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night.
2127245     588         I am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger – ever present danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.
2127246     588         And have I not cause for such a feeling?
2127247     588         Consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us.
2127248     588         There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.
2127249     588         Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant baying of a hound.
2127250     588         It is incredible, impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature.
2127251     588         A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of.
2127252     588         Stapleton may fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing.
2127253     588         To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.
2127254     588         Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent.
2127255     588         But facts are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor.
2127256     588         Suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain everything.
2127257     588         But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?
2127258     588         It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other.
2127259     588         And always, apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor.
2127260     588         This at least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy.
2127261     588         Where is that friend or enemy now?
2127262     588         Has he remained in London, or has he followed us down here?
2127263     588         Could he – could he be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?
2127264     588         It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are some things to which I am ready to swear.
2127265     588         He is no one whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the neighbours.
2127266     588         The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.
2127267     588         Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he could not have followed us.
2127268     588         A stranger then is still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London.
2127269     588         We have never shaken him off.
2127270     588         If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties.
2127271     588         To this one purpose I must now devote all my energies.
2127272     588         My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans.
2127273     588         My second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible ta anyone.
2127274     588         He is silent and distrait.
2127275     588         His nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor.
2127276     588         I will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.
2127277     588         We had a small scene this morning after breakfast.
2127278     588         Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little time.
2127279     588         Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion.
2127280     588         After a time the baronet opened his door and called for me.
2127281     588         "Barrymore considers that he has a grievance," he said.
2127282     588         "He thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his own free will, had told us the secret."
2127283     588         The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.
2127284     588         "I may have spoken too warmly, sir," said he, "and if I have, I am sure that I beg your pardon.
2127285     588         At the same time, I was very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden.
2127286     588         The poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track."
2127287     588         "If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing," said the baronet, "you only told us, or rather your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself."
2127288     588         "I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry – indeed I didn't."
2127289     588         "The man is a public danger.
2127290     588         There are lonely houses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing.
2127291     588         You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that.
2127292     588         Look at Mr. Stapleton's house, for example, with no one but himself to defend it.
2127293     588         There's no safety for anyone untill he is under lock and key."
2127294     588         "He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.
2127295     588         But he will never trouble anyone in this country again.
2127296     588         I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South America. For God's sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.
2127297     588         They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him.
2127298     588         You can't tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble.
2127299     588         I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police."
2127300     588         "What do you say, Watson?"
2127301     588         I shrugged my shoulders.
2127302     588         "If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden."
2127303     588         "But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?"
2127304     588         "He would not do anything so mad, sir.
2127305     588         We have provided him with all that he can want.
2127306     588         To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding."
2127307     588         "That is true," said Sir Henry.
2127308     588         "Well, Barrymore –"
2127309     588         "God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart!
2127310     588         It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again."
2127311     588         "I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson?
2127312     588         But, after what we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it.
2127313     588         All right, Barrymore, you can go."
2127314     588         With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back.
2127315     588         "You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can for you in return.
2127316     588         I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it out.
2127317     588         I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man.
2127318     588         It's about poor Sir Charles's death."
2127319     588         The baronet and I were both upon our feet.
2127320     588         "Do you know how he died?"
2127321     588         "No, sir, I don't know that."
2127322     588         "What then?"
2127323     588         "I know why he was at the gate at that hour.
2127324     588         It was to meet a woman."
2127325     588         "To meet a woman!
2127326     588         He?"
2127327     588         "Yes, sir."
2127328     588         "And the woman's name?"
2127329     588         "I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.
2127330     588         Her initials were L.
2127331     588         L."
2127332     588         "How do you know this, Barrymore?"
2127333     588         "Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning.
2127334     588         He had usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him.
2127335     588         But that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it.
2127336     588         It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman's hand."
2127337     588         "Well?"
2127338     588         "Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had it not been for my wife.
2127339     588         Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles's study – it had never been touched since his death – and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate.
2127340     588         The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was gray on a black ground.
2127341     588         It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said:
2127342     588         'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock.
2127343     588         Beneath it were signed the initials L.
2127344     588         L."
2127345     588         "Have you got that slip?"
2127346     588         "No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it."
2127347     588         "Had Sir Charles received any other lettefs in the same writting?"
2127348     588         "Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters.
2127349     588         I should not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone."
2127350     588         "And you have no idea who L.
2127351     588         L. is?"
2127352     588         "No, sir. No more than you have.
2127353     588         But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death."
2127354     588         "I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important information."
2127355     588         "Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.
2127356     588         And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for us.
2127357     588         To rake this up couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case.
2127358     588         Even the best of us –"
2127359     588         "You thought it might injure his reputation?"
2127360     588         "Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it.
2127361     588         But now you have been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter."
2127362     588         "Very good, Barrymore; you can go."
2127363     588         When the butler had left us Sir Henry turned to me.
2127364     588         "Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?"
2127365     588         "It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before."
2127366     588         "So I think.
2127367     588         But if we can only trace L.
2127368     588         L. it should clear up the whole business.
2127369     588         We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her.
2127370     588         What do you think we should do?"
2127371     588         "Let Holmes know all about it at once.
2127372     588         It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking.
2127373     588         I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down."
2127374     588         I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's conversation for Holmes.
2127375     588         It was evident to me that he had been very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission.
2127376     588         No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties.
2127377     588         And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest.
2127378     588         I wish that he were here.
2127379     588         October 17th.
2127380     588         All day to-day the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves.
2127381     588         I thought of the convict out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor.
2127382     588         Poor devil!
2127383     588         Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them.
2127384     588         And then I thought of that other one – the face in the cab, the figure against the moon.
2127385     588         Was he also out in that deluged – the unseen watcher, the man of darkness?
2127386     588         In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.
2127387     588         God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass.
2127388     588         I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs.
2127389     588         Rain squalls drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills.
2127390     588         In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees.
2127391     588         They were the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills.
2127392     588         Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights before.
2127393     588         As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of Foulmire.
2127394     588         He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on.
2127395     588         He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward.
2127396     588         I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel.
2127397     588         It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back.
2127398     588         I gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.
2127399     588         "By the way, Mortimer," said I as we jolted along the rough road, "I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know?"
2127400     588         "Hardly any, I think."
2127401     588         "Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L.
2127402     588         L.?"
2127403     588         He thought for a few minutes.
2127404     588         "No," said he.
2127405     588         "There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those.
2127406     588         Wait a bit though," he added after a pause. "There is Laura Lyons – her initials are L.
2127407     588         L. – but she lives in Coombe Tracey."
2127408     588         "Who is she?" I asked.
2127409     588         "She is Frankland's daughter."
2127410     588         "What!
2127411     588         Old Frankland the crank?"
2127412     588         "Exactly.
2127413     588         She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the moor.
2127414     588         He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her.
2127415     588         The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.
2127416     588         Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well.
2127417     588         So, between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time."
2127418     588         "How does she live?"
2127419     588         "I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more, for his own affairs are considerably involved.
2127420     588         Whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad.
2127421     588         Her story got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for another.
2127422     588         I gave a trifle myself.
2127423     588         It was to set her up in a typewriting business."
2127424     588         He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence.
2127425     588         To-morrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries.
2127426     588         I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
2127427     588         I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.
2127428     588         I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day.
2127429     588         This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.
2127430     588         Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards.
2127431     588         The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.
2127432     588         "Well," said I, "has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he still lurking out yonder?"
2127433     588         "I don't know, sir.
2127434     588         I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here!
2127435     588         I've not heard of him since I left out food for him last, and that was three days ago."
2127436     588         "Did you see him then?"
2127437     588         "No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way."
2127438     588         "Then he was certainly there?"
2127439     588         "So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it."
2127440     588         I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.
2127441     588         "You know that there is another man then?"
2127442     588         "Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor."
2127443     588         "Have you seen him?"
2127444     588         "No, sir."
2127445     588         "How do you know of him then?"
2127446     588         "Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more.
2127447     588         He's in hiding, too, but he's not a convict as far as I can make out.
2127448     588         I don't like it, Dr. Watson – I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it." He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.
2127449     588         "Now, listen to me, Barrymore!
2127450     588         I have no interest in this matter but that of your master.
2127451     588         I have come here with no object except to help him.
2127452     588         Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like."
2127453     588         Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.
2127454     588         "It's all these goings-on, sir," he cried at last, waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.
2127455     588         "There's foul play somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll swear!
2127456     588         Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again!"
2127457     588         "But what is it that alarms you?"
2127458     588         "Look at Sir Charles's death!
2127459     588         That was bad enough, for all that the coroner said.
2127460     588         Look at the noises on the moor at night.
2127461     588         There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it.
2127462     588         Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting for?
2127463     588         What does it mean?
2127464     588         It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall."
2127465     588         "But about this stranger," said I.
2127466     588         "Can you tell me anything about him?
2127467     588         What did Selden say?
2127468     588         Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?"
2127469     588         "He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.
2127470     588         At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he had some lay of his own.
2127471     588         A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not make out."
2127472     588         "And where did he say that he lived?"
2127473     588         "Among the old houses on the hillside – the stone huts where the old folk used to live."
2127474     588         "But how about his food?"
2127475     588         "Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs.
2127476     588         I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants."
2127477     588         "Very good, Barrymore.
2127478     588         We may talk further of this some other time."
2127479     588         When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees.
2127480     588         It is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.
2127481     588         What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time!
2127482     588         And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial!
2127483     588         There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely.
2127484     588         I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery.
2127485     588         Chapter 11 – The Man on the Tor
2127486     588         The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.
2127487     588         The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time.
2127488     588         I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour tha
2127489     588         With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark places.
2127490     588         I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late.
2127491     588         At breakfast, however, I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey.
2127492     588         At first he was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better.
2127493     588         The more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain.
2127494     588         I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.
2127495     588         When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.
2127496     588         I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.
2127497     588         A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome.
2127498     588         Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.
2127499     588         The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty.
2127500     588         Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.
2127501     588         Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression.
2127502     588         But the second was criticism.
2127503     588         There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty.
2127504     588         But these, of course, are after-thoughts.
2127505     588         At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit.
2127506     588         I had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was.
2127507     588         "I have the pleasure," said I, "of knowing your father."
2127508     588         It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.
2127509     588         "There is nothing in common between my father and me," she said.
2127510     588         "I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine.
2127511     588         If it were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared."
2127512     588         "It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you."
2127513     588         The freckles started out on the lady's face.
2127514     588         "What can I tell you about him?" she asked, and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.
2127515     588         "You knew him, did you not?"
2127516     588         "I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness.
2127517     588         If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation."
2127518     588         "Did you correspond with him?"
2127519     588         The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.
2127520     588         "What is the object of these questions?" she asked sharply.
2127521     588         "The object is to avoid a public scandal.
2127522     588         It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control."
2127523     588         She was silent and her face was still very pale.
2127524     588         At last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.
2127525     588         "Well, I'll answer," she said.
2127526     588         "What are your questions?"
2127527     588         "Did you correspond with Sir Charles?"
2127528     588         "I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity."
2127529     588         "Have you the dates of those letters?"
2127530     588         "No."
2127531     588         "Have you ever met him?"
2127532     588         "Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey.
2127533     588         He was a very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth."
2127534     588         "But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?"
2127535     588         She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.
2127536     588         "There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me.
2127537     588         One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir Charles's.
2127538     588         He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs."
2127539     588         I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it.
2127540     588         "Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?" I continued.
2127541     588         Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again.
2127542     588         "Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question."
2127543     588         "I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it."
2127544     588         "Then I answer, certainly not."
2127545     588         "Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?"
2127546     588         The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me.
2127547     588         Her dry lips could not speak the "No" which I saw rather than heard.
2127548     588         "Surely your memory deceives you," said I.
2127549     588         "I could even quote a passage of your letter.
2127550     588         It ran
2127551     588         'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.' "
2127552     588         I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme effort.
2127553     588         "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?" she gasped.
2127554     588         "You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter.
2127555     588         But sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned.
2127556     588         You acknowledge now that you wrote it?"
2127557     588         "Yes, I did write it," she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of words. "I did write it. Why should I deny it?
2127558     588         I have no reason to be ashamed of it.
2127559     588         I wished him to help me.
2127560     588         I believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me."
2127561     588         "But why at such an hour?"
2127562     588         "Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day and might be away for months.
2127563     588         There were reasons why I could not get there earlier."
2127564     588         "But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?"
2127565     588         "Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house?"
2127566     588         "Well, what happened when you did get there?"
2127567     588         "I never went."
2127568     588         "Mrs. Lyons!"
2127569     588         "No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.
2127570     588         Something intervened to prevent my going."
2127571     588         "What was that?"
2127572     588         "That is a private matter. I cannot tell it."
2127573     588         "You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you kept the appointment."
2127574     588         "That is the truth."
2127575     588         Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that point.
2127576     588         "Mrs. Lyons," said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive interview, "you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know.
2127577     588         If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised.
2127578     588         If your position is innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?"
2127579     588         "Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal."
2127580     588         "And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your letter?"
2127581     588         "If you have read the letter you will know."
2127582     588         "I did not say that I had read all the letter."
2127583     588         "You quoted some of it."
2127584     588         "I quoted the postscript.
2127585     588         The letter had, as I said, been burned and it was not all legible.
2127586     588         I ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death."
2127587     588         "The matter is a very private one."
2127588     588         "The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation."
2127589     588         "I will tell you, then.
2127590     588         If you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it."
2127591     588         "I have heard so much."
2127592     588         "My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.
2127593     588         The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him.
2127594     588         At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met.
2127595     588         It meant everything to me – peace of mind, happiness, self-respect – everything.
2127596     588         I knew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me."
2127597     588         "Then how is it that you did not go?"
2127598     588         "Because I received help in the interval from another source."
2127599     588         "Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?"
2127600     588         "So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next morning."
2127601     588         The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it.
2127602     588         I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
2127603     588         It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning.
2127604     588         Such an excursion could not be kept secret.
2127605     588         The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part of the truth.
2127606     588         I came away baffled and disheartened.
2127607     588         Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission.
2127608     588         And yet the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me.
2127609     588         Why should she turn so pale?
2127610     588         Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?
2127611     588         Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?
2127612     588         Surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe.
2127613     588         For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor.
2127614     588         And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.
2127615     588         Barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor.
2127616     588         But I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor.
2127617     588         That, then, should be the centre of my search.
2127618     588         From there I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one.
2127619     588         If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged us so long.
2127620     588         He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor.
2127621     588         On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned.
2127622     588         Holmes had missed him in London.
2127623     588         It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth where my master had failed.
2127624     588         Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of bis garden, which opened o
2127625     588         "Good-day, Dr. Watson," cried he with unwonted good humour, "you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me."
2127626     588         My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one.
2127627     588         I alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.
2127628     588         "It is a great day for me, sir – one of the red-letter days of my life," he cried with many chuckles.
2127629     588         "I have brought off a double event.
2127630     588         I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it.
2127631     588         I have established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton's park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own front door.
2127632     588         What do you think of that?
2127633     588         We'll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners, confound them!
2127634     588         And I've closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic.
2127635     588         These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles.
2127636     588         Both cases decided Dr. Watson, and both in my favour.
2127637     588         I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren."
2127638     588         "How on earth did you do that?"
2127639     588         "Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading – Frankland v. Morland, Court of Queen's Bench.
2127640     588         It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my verdict."
2127641     588         "Did it do you any good?"
2127642     588         "None, sir, none.
2127643     588         I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter.
2127644     588         I act entirely from a sense of public duty.
2127645     588         I have no doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-night.
2127646     588         I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions.
2127647     588         The County Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am entitled.
2127648     588         The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public.
2127649     588         I told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true."
2127650     588         "How so?" I asked.
2127651     588         The oId man put on a very knowing expression.
2127652     588         "Because I could tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way."
2127653     588         I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it.
2127654     588         I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences. "Some poaching case, no doubt?" said I with an indifferent manner~
2127655     588         "Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!
2127656     588         What about the convict on the moor?"
2127657     588         I stared.
2127658     588         "You don't mean that you know where he is?" said I.
2127659     588         "I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could help the police to lay their hands on him.
2127660     588         Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him?"
2127661     588         He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth.
2127662     588         "No doubt," said I; "but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?"
2127663     588         "I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food."
2127664     588         My heart sank for Barrymore.
2127665     588         It was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody.
2127666     588         But his next remark took a weight from my mind.
2127667     588         "You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.
2127668     588         I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof.
2127669     588         He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?"
2127670     588         Here was luck indeed!
2127671     588         And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest.
2127672     588         A child!
2127673     588         Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy.
2127674     588         It was on his track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled.
2127675     588         If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt.
2127676     588         But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.
2127677     588         "I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner."
2127678     588         The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
2127679     588         His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.
2127680     588         "Indeed, sir!" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. "Do you see that Black Tor over yonder?
2127681     588         Well, do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it?
2127682     588         It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.
2127683     588         Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?
2127684     588         Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one."
2127685     588         I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts.
2127686     588         My submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.
2127687     588         "You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an opinion.
2127688     588         I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle.
2127689     588         Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able – but wait a moment, Dr. Watson.
2127690     588         Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?"
2127691     588         It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray.
2127692     588         "Come, sir, come!" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs.
2127693     588         "You will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself."
2127694     588         The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon the flat leads of the house.
2127695     588         Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.
2127696     588         "Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!"
2127697     588         There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill.
2127698     588         When he reached the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky.
2127699     588         He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.
2127700     588         "Well! Am I right?"
2127701     588         "Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand."
2127702     588         "And what the errand is even a county constable could guess.
2127703     588         But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Watson.
2127704     588         Not a word! You understand!"
2127705     588         "Just as you wish."
2127706     588         "They have treated me shamefully – shamefully.
2127707     588         When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country.
2127708     588         Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way.
2127709     588         For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake.
2127710     588         Surely you are not going!
2127711     588         You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!"
2127712     588         But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me.
2127713     588         I kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared.
2127714     588         Everything was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.
2127715     588         The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray shadow on the other.
2127716     588         A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor.
2127717     588         Over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement.
2127718     588         One great gray bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven.
2127719     588         He and I seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it.
2127720     588         The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart.
2127721     588         The boy was nowhere to be seen.
2127722     588         But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather.
2127723     588         My heart leaped within me as I saw it.
2127724     588         This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked.
2127725     588         At last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place – his secret was within my grasp.
2127726     588         As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation.
2127727     588         A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door.
2127728     588         All was silent within.
2127729     588         The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the moor.
2127730     588         My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure.
2127731     588         Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in.
2127732     588         The place was empty.
2127733     588         But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This was certainly where the man lived.
2127734     588         Some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered.
2127735     588         The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate.
2127736     588         Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water.
2127737     588         A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner.
2127738     588         In the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundle – the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy.
2127739     588         It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches.
2127740     588         As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it.
2127741     588         I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil:
2127742     588         "Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey."
2127743     588         For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message.
2127744     588         It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was being aogged by this secret man.
2127745     588         He had not followed me himself, but he had set an agent – the boy, perhaps – upon my track, and this was his report.
2127746     588         Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported.
2127747     588         Always there was this feeling of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed-entangled in its meshes.
2127748     588         If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut in search of them.
2127749     588         There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of li
2127750     588         When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode.
2127751     588         Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel?
2127752     588         I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.
2127753     588         Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold.
2127754     588         Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire.
2127755     588         There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen.
2127756     588         Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons.
2127757     588         All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer.
2127758     588         With tingling nerves but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.
2127759     588         And then at last I heard him.
2127760     588         Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone.
2127761     588         Then another and yet another, coming nearer and nearer.
2127762     588         I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger.
2127763     588         There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped.
2127764     588         Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut.
2127765     588         "It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson," said a well-known voice.
2127766     588         "I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in."
2127767     588         Chapter 12 – Death on the Moor
2127768     588         For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.
2127769     588         Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul.
2127770     588         That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.
2127771     588         "Holmes!" I cried –
2127772     588         "Holmes!"
2127773     588         "Come out," said he, "and please be careful with the revolver."
2127774     588         I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features.
2127775     588         He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind.
2127776     588         In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he w
2127777     588         "I never was more glad to see anyone in my life," said I as I wrung him by the hand.
2127778     588         "Or more astonished, eh?"
2127779     588         "Well, I must confess to it."
2127780     588         "The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door."
2127781     588         "My footprint, I presume?"
2127782     588         "No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world.
2127783     588         If you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood.
2127784     588         You will see it there beside the path.
2127785     588         You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut."
2127786     588         "Exactly."
2127787     588         "I thought as much – and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return.
2127788     588         So you actually thought that I was the criminal?"
2127789     588         "I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out."
2127790     588         "Excellent, Watson!
2127791     588         And how did you localize me?
2127792     588         You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?"
2127793     588         "Yes, I saw you then."
2127794     588         "And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?"
2127795     588         "No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to look."
2127796     588         "The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt.
2127797     588         I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens."
2127798     588         He rose and peeped into the hut.
2127799     588         "Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.
2127800     588         What's this paper?
2127801     588         So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?"
2127802     588         "Yes."
2127803     588         "To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?"
2127804     588         "Exactly."
2127805     588         "Well done!
2127806     588         Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case."
2127807     588         "Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves.
2127808     588         But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing?
2127809     588         I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing."
2127810     588         "That was what I wished you to think."
2127811     588         "Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!" I cried with some bitterness.
2127812     588         "I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes."
2127813     588         "My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you.
2127814     588         In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself.
2127815     588         Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard.
2127816     588         As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment."
2127817     588         "But why keep me in the dark?"
2127818     588         "For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery.
2127819     588         You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run.
2127820     588         I brought Cartwright down with me – you remember the little chap at the express office – and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want more?
2127821     588         He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and both have been invaluable."
2127822     588         "Then my reports have all been wasted!" – My voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.
2127823     588         Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.
2127824     588         "Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you.
2127825     588         I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way.
2127826     588         I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case."
2127827     588         I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind.
2127828     588         I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor.
2127829     588         "That's better," said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.
2127830     588         "And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons – it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter.
2127831     588         In fact, if you had not gone to-day it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone to-morrow."
2127832     588         The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor.
2127833     588         The air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth.
2127834     588         There sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady.
2127835     588         So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.
2127836     588         "This is most important," said he when I had concluded.
2127837     588         "It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair.
2127838     588         You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton?"
2127839     588         "I did not know of a close intimacy."
2127840     588         "There can be no doubt about the matter.
2127841     588         They meet, they write, there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands.
2127842     588         If I could only use it to detach his wife "
2127843     588         "His wife?"
2127844     588         "I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have given me.
2127845     588         The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife."
2127846     588         "Good heavens, Holmes!
2127847     588         Are you sure of what you say?
2127848     588         How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?"
2127849     588         "Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry.
2127850     588         He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed.
2127851     588         I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister."
2127852     588         "But why this elaborate deception?"
2127853     588         "Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman."
2127854     588         All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist.
2127855     588         In that impassive colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible – a creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.
2127856     588         "It is he, then, who is our enemy – it is he who dogged us in London?"
2127857     588         "So I read the riddle."
2127858     588         "And the warning – it must have come from her!"
2127859     588         "Exactly."
2127860     588         The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.
2127861     588         "But are you sure of this, Holmes?
2127862     588         How do you know that the woman is his wife?"
2127863     588         "Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since.
2127864     588         He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England.
2127865     588         Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster.
2127866     588         There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.
2127867     588         A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned it – the name was different – had disappeared with his wife.
2127868     588         The descriptions agreed.
2127869     588         When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete."
2127870     588         The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.
2127871     588         "If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come in?" I asked.
2127872     588         "That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light.
2127873     588         Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much.
2127874     588         I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband.
2127875     588         In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife."
2127876     588         "And when she is undeceived?"
2127877     588         "Why, then we may find the lady of service.
2127878     588         It must be our first duty to see her – both of us – to-morrow.
2127879     588         Don't you think, Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long?
2127880     588         Your place should be at Baskerville Hall."
2127881     588         The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor.
2127882     588         A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.
2127883     588         "One last question, Holmes," I said as I rose.
2127884     588         "Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me.
2127885     588         What is the meaning of it all?
2127886     588         What is he after?"
2127887     588         Holmes's voice sank as he answered:
2127888     588         "It is murder, Watson – refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.
2127889     588         Do not ask me for particulars.
2127890     588         My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy.
2127891     588         There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.
2127892     588         Another day – two at the most – and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child.
2127893     588         Your mission to-day has justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side.
2127894     588         Hark!"
2127895     588         A terrible scream – a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor.
2127896     588         That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins.
2127897     588         "Oh, my God!" I gasped.
2127898     588         "What is it?
2127899     588         What does it mean?"
2127900     588         Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.
2127901     588         "Hush!" he whispered.
2127902     588         "Hush!"
2127903     588         The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain.
2127904     588         Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.
2127905     588         "Where is it?" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.
2127906     588         "Where is it, Watson?"
2127907     588         "There, I think."
2127908     588         I pointed into the darkness.
2127909     588         "No, there!"
2127910     588         Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much nearer than ever.
2127911     588         And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.
2127912     588         "The hound!" cried Holmes.
2127913     588         "Come, Watson, come!
2127914     588         Great heavens, if we are too late!"
2127915     588         He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels.
2127916     588         But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud.
2127917     588         We halted and listened.
2127918     588         Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.
2127919     588         I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his feet upon the ground.
2127920     588         "He has beaten us, Watson.
2127921     588         We are too late."
2127922     588         "No, no, surely not!"
2127923     588         "Fool that I was to hold my hand.
2127924     588         And you, Watson, see what comes of abandoning your charge!
2127925     588         But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we'll avenge him!"
2127926     588         Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.
2127927     588         At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.
2127928     588         "Can you see anything?"
2127929     588         "Nothing."
2127930     588         "But, hark, what is that?"
2127931     588         A low moan had fallen upon our ears.
2127932     588         There it was again upon our left!
2127933     588         On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope.
2127934     588         On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark, irregular object.
2127935     588         As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape.
2127936     588         It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.
2127937     588         So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul.
2127938     588         Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped.
2127939     588         Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.
2127940     588         The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim.
2127941     588         And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us – the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!
2127942     588         There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit – the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in Baker Street.
2127943     588         We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls.
2127944     588         Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.
2127945     588         "The brute! the brute!"
2127946     588         I cried with clenched hands.
2127947     588         "Oh Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate."
2127948     588         "I am more to blame than you, Watson.
2127949     588         In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client.
2127950     588         It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career.
2127951     588         But how could I know – how could l know – that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?"
2127952     588         "That we should have heard his screams – my God, those screams! – and yet have been unable to save him!
2127953     588         Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death?
2127954     588         It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.
2127955     588         And Stapleton, where is he?
2127956     588         He shall answer for this deed."
2127957     588         "He shall. I will see to that.
2127958     588         Uncle and nephew have been murdered – the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it.
2127959     588         But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast.
2127960     588         Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall.
2127961     588         But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!"
2127962     588         We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end.
2127963     588         Then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom.
2127964     588         Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining.
2127965     588         It could only come from the lonely abode of the Stapletons.
2127966     588         With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.
2127967     588         "Why should we not seize him at once?"
2127968     588         "Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree.
2127969     588         It is not what we know, but what we can prove.
2127970     588         If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet."
2127971     588         "What can we do?"
2127972     588         "There will be plenty for us to do to-morrow.
2127973     588         To-night we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend."
2127974     588         Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.
2127975     588         The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.
2127976     588         "We must send for help, Holmes!
2127977     588         We cannot carry him all the way to the Hall.
2127978     588         Good heavens, are you mad?"
2127979     588         He had uttered a cry and bent over the body.
2127980     588         Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand.
2127981     588         Could this be my stern, self-contained friend?
2127982     588         These were hidden fires, indeed!
2127983     588         "A beard!
2127984     588         A beard! The man has a beard!"
2127985     588         "A beard?"
2127986     588         "It is not the baronet – it is – why, it is my neighbour, the convict!"
2127987     588         With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon.
2127988     588         There could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes.
2127989     588         It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock – the face of Selden, the criminal.
2127990     588         Then in an instant it was all clear to me.
2127991     588         I remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore.
2127992     588         Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape.
2127993     588         Boots, shirt, cap – it was all Sir Henry's.
2127994     588         The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country.
2127995     588         I told Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.
2127996     588         "Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death," said he.
2127997     588         "It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry's – the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability – and so ran this man down.
2127998     588         There is one very singular thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on his trail?"
2127999     588         "He heard him."
2128000     588         "To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help.
2128001     588         By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track.
2128002     588         How did he know?"
2128003     588         "A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our conjectures are correct –"
2128004     588         "I presume nothing."
2128005     588         "Well, then, why this hound should be loose to-night.
2128006     588         I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor.
2128007     588         Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there."
2128008     588         "My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery.
2128009     588         The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch's body?
2128010     588         We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens."
2128011     588         "I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police."
2128012     588         "Exactly.
2128013     588         I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.
2128014     588         Halloa, Watson, what's this?
2128015     588         It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and audacious!
2128016     588         Not a word to show yow suspicions – not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground."
2128017     588         A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar.
2128018     588         The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist.
2128019     588         He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.
2128020     588         "Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it?
2128021     588         You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night.
2128022     588         But, dear me, what's this?
2128023     588         Somebody hurt?
2128024     588         Not – don't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!"
2128025     588         He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man.
2128026     588         I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.
2128027     588         "Who – who's this?" he stammered. "It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown."
2128028     588         Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment.
2128029     588         He looked sharply from Holmes to me.
2128030     588         "Dear me! What a very shocking affair!
2128031     588         How did he die?"
2128032     588         "He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.
2128033     588         My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry." "I heard a cry also.
2128034     588         That was what brought me out.
2128035     588         I was uneasy about Sir Henry."
2128036     588         "Why about Sir Henry in particular?" I could not help asking.
2128037     588         "Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor.
2128038     588         By the way" – his eyes darted again from my face to Holmes's – "did you hear anything else besides a cry?"
2128039     588         "No," said Holmes; "did you?"
2128040     588         "No."
2128041     588         "What do you mean, then?"
2128042     588         "Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on.
2128043     588         It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.
2128044     588         I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to-night."
2128045     588         "We heard nothing of the kind," said I.
2128046     588         "And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?"
2128047     588         "I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
2128048     588         He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck."
2128049     588         "That seems the most reasonable theory," said Stapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief.
2128050     588         "What do you think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
2128051     588         My friend bowed his compliments. "You are quick at identification," said he.
2128052     588         "We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.
2128053     588         You are in time to see a tragedy."
2128054     588         "Yes, indeed.
2128055     588         I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover the facts.
2128056     588         I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me to-morrow."
2128057     588         "Oh, you return to-morrow?"
2128058     588         "That is my intention."
2128059     588         "I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us?"
2128060     588         Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
2128061     588         "One cannot always have the success for which one hopes.
2128062     588         An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours.
2128063     588         It has not been a satisfactory case."
2128064     588         My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.
2128065     588         Stapleton still looked hard at him.
2128066     588         Then he turned to me.
2128067     588         "I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.
2128068     588         I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning."
2128069     588         And so it was arranged.
2128070     588         Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone.
2128071     588         Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end. Chapter 13 – Fixing the Nets
2128072     588         "We're at close grips at last," said Holmes as we walked together across the moor.
2128073     588         "What a nerve the fellow has!
2128074     588         How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot.
2128075     588         I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel."
2128076     588         "I am sorry that he has seen you."
2128077     588         "And so was I at first.
2128078     588         But there was no getting out of it."
2128079     588         "What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?"
2128080     588         "It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate measures at once.
2128081     588         Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us."
2128082     588         "Why should we not arrest him at once?"
2128083     588         "My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action.
2128084     588         Your instinct is always to do something energetic.
2128085     588         But supposing, for argument's sake, that we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the better off should we be for that?
2128086     588         We could prove nothing against him.
2128087     588         There's the devilish cunning of it!
2128088     588         If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master."
2128089     588         "Surely we have a case."
2128090     588         "Not a shadow of one – only surmise and conjecture.
2128091     588         We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence."
2128092     588         "There is Sir Charles's death."
2128093     588         "Found dead without a mark upon him.
2128094     588         You and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it?
2128095     588         What signs are there of a hound?
2128096     588         Where are the marks of its fangs?
2128097     588         Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him.
2128098     588         But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it."
2128099     588         "Well, then, to-night?"
2128100     588         "We are not much better off to-night.
2128101     588         Again, there was no direct connection between the hound and the man's death.
2128102     588         We never saw the hound.
2128103     588         We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this man's trail.
2128104     588         There is a complete absence of motive.
2128105     588         No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one."
2128106     588         "And how do you propose to do so?"
2128107     588         "I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her.
2128108     588         And I have my own plan as well.
2128109     588         Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last."
2128110     588         I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.
2128111     588         "Are you coming up?"
2128112     588         "Yes; I see no reason for further concealment.
2128113     588         But one last word, Watson.
2128114     588         Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry.
2128115     588         Let him think that Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe.
2128116     588         He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to-morrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these people."
2128117     588         "And so am I."
2128118     588         "Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily arranged.
2128119     588         And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are both ready for our suppers."
2128120     588         Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from London.
2128121     588         He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.
2128122     588         Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know.
2128123     588         But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore and his wife.
2128124     588         To him it may have been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron.
2128125     588         To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand.
2128126     588         Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.
2128127     588         "I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning," said the baronet.
2128128     588         "I guess I should have some credit, for I have kept my promise.
2128129     588         If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over there."
2128130     588         "I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening," said Holmes drily.
2128131     588         "By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?"
2128132     588         Sir Henry opened his eyes.
2128133     588         "How was that?"
2128134     588         "This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes.
2128135     588         I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police."
2128136     588         "That is unlikely.
2128137     588         There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know."
2128138     588         "That's lucky for him – in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter.
2128139     588         I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household.
2128140     588         Watson's reports are most incriminating documents."
2128141     588         "But how about the case?" asked the baronet.
2128142     588         "Have you made anything out of the tangle?
2128143     588         I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down."
2128144     588         "I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long.
2128145     588         It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business.
2128146     588         There are several points upon which we still want light – but it is coming all the same."
2128147     588         "We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
2128148     588         I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when I hear one.
2128149     588         If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time."
2128150     588         "I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help."
2128151     588         "Whatever you tell me to do I will do."
2128152     588         "Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always asking the reason."
2128153     588         "Just as you like."
2128154     588         "If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved.
2128155     588         I have no doubt "
2128156     588         He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air.
2128157     588         The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.
2128158     588         "What is it?" we both cried.
2128159     588         I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion.
2128160     588         His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation.
2128161     588         "Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur," said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall.
2128162     588         "Watson won't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ.
2128163     588         Now, these are a really very fine series of portraits."
2128164     588         "Well, I'm glad to hear you say so," said Sir Henry, glancing with some surprise at my friend.
2128165     588         "I don't pretend to know much about these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture.
2128166     588         I didn't know that you found time for such things. "
2128167     588         "I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now.
2128168     588         That's a Kneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds.
2128169     588         They are all family portraits, I presume?"
2128170     588         "Every one."
2128171     588         "Do you know the names?"
2128172     588         "Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my lessons fairly well."
2128173     588         "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?"
2128174     588         "That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West Indies.
2128175     588         The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt."
2128176     588         "And this Cavalier opposite to me – the one with the black velvet and the lace?"
2128177     588         "Ah, you have a right to know about him.
2128178     588         That is the cause of all the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
2128179     588         We're not likely to forget him."
2128180     588         I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.
2128181     588         "Dear me!" said Holmes, "he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes.
2128182     588         I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person."
2128183     588         "There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas."
2128184     588         Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper.
2128185     588         It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts.
2128186     588         He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.
2128187     588         "Do you see anything there?"
2128188     588         I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. lt was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly
2128189     588         "Is it like anyone you know?"
2128190     588         "There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw."
2128191     588         "Just a suggestion, perhaps.
2128192     588         But wait an instant!"
2128193     588         He stood upon a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.
2128194     588         "Good heavens!" I cried in amazement.
2128195     588         The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.
2128196     588         "Ha, you see it now.
2128197     588         My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings.
2128198     588         It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise."
2128199     588         "But this is marvellous.
2128200     588         It might be his portrait."
2128201     588         "Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be both physical and spiritual.
2128202     588         A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation.
2128203     588         The fellow is a Baskerville – that is evident."
2128204     588         "With designs upon the succession."
2128205     588         "Exactly.
2128206     588         This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links.
2128207     588         We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare swear that before to-morrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies.
2128208     588         A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!"
2128209     588         He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture.
2128210     588         I have not heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.
2128211     588         I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.
2128212     588         "Yes, we should have a full day to-day," he remarked, and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action.
2128213     588         "The nets are all in place, and the drag is about to begin.
2128214     588         We'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the meshes."
2128215     588         "Have you been on the moor already?"
2128216     588         "I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden.
2128217     588         I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter.
2128218     588         And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at his master's grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety."
2128219     588         "What is the next move?"
2128220     588         "To see Sir Henry.
2128221     588         Ah, here he is!"
2128222     588         "Good-morning, Holmes," said the baronet.
2128223     588         "You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff."
2128224     588         "That is the exact situation.
2128225     588         Watson was asking for orders."
2128226     588         "And so do I."
2128227     588         "Very good.
2128228     588         You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends the Stapletons to-night."
2128229     588         "I hope that you will come also.
2128230     588         They are very hospitable people, and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you."
2128231     588         "I fear that Watson and I must go to London."
2128232     588         "To London?"
2128233     588         "Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture."
2128234     588         The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened.
2128235     588         "I hoped that you were going to see me through this business.
2128236     588         The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone."
2128237     588         "My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you.
2128238     588         You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town.
2128239     588         We hope very soon to return to Devonshire.
2128240     588         Will you remember to give them that message?"
2128241     588         "If you insist upon it."
2128242     588         "There is no alternative, I assure you."
2128243     588         I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion.
2128244     588         "When do you desire to go?" he asked coldly.
2128245     588         "Immediately after breakfast.
2128246     588         We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.
2128247     588         Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come."
2128248     588         "I have a good mind to go to London with you," said the baronet.
2128249     588         "Why should I stay here alone?"
2128250     588         "Because it is your post of duty.
2128251     588         Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay."
2128252     588         "All right, then, I'll stay."
2128253     588         "One more direction!
2128254     588         I wish you to drive to Merripit House Send back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home."
2128255     588         "To walk across the moor?"
2128256     588         "Yes."
2128257     588         "But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do."
2128258     588         "This time you may do it with safety.
2128259     588         If I had not every confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that you should do it."
2128260     588         "Then I will do it."
2128261     588         "And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home."
2128262     588         "I will do just what you say."
2128263     588         "Very good.
2128264     588         I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon."
2128265     588         I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day.
2128266     588         It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical.
2128267     588         There was nothing for it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey.
2128268     588         A small boy was waiting upon the platform.
2128269     588         "Any orders, sir?"
2128270     588         "You will take this train to town, Cartwright.
2128271     588         The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street."
2128272     588         "Yes, sir."
2128273     588         "And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."
2128274     588         The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me.
2128275     588         It ran:
2128276     588         Wire received.
2128277     588         Coming down with unsigned warrant.
2128278     588         Arrive five-forty.
2128279     588         Lestrade.
2128280     588         "That is in answer to mine of this morning.
2128281     588         He is the best of the professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance.
2128282     588         Now, Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons."
2128283     588         His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident.
2128284     588         He would use the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed.
2128285     588         That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds.
2128286     588         Already I seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.
2128287     588         Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.
2128288     588         "I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville," said he.
2128289     588         "My friend here, Dr. Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter."
2128290     588         "What have I withheld?" she asked defiantly.
2128291     588         "You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock.
2128292     588         We know that that was the place and hour of his death.
2128293     588         You have withheld what the connection is between these events."
2128294     588         "There is no connection."
2128295     588         "In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one.
2128296     588         But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all.
2128297     588         I wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons.
2128298     588         We regard this case as one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as well."
2128299     588         The lady sprang from her chair.
2128300     588         "His wife!" she cried.
2128301     588         "The fact is no longer a secret.
2128302     588         The person who has passed for his sister is really his wife."
2128303     588         Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip.
2128304     588         "His wife!" she said again.
2128305     588         "His wife!
2128306     588         He is not a married man."
2128307     588         Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
2128308     588         "Prove it to me!
2128309     588         Prove it to me!
2128310     588         And if you can do so –!"
2128311     588         The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.
2128312     588         "I have come prepared to do so," said Holmes, drawing several papers from his pocket.
2128313     588         "Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years ago.
2128314     588         It is indorsed
2128315     588         'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.
2128316     588         Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school.
2128317     588         Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people."
2128318     588         She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set rigid face of a desperate woman.
2128319     588         "Mr. Holmes," she said, "this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband.
2128320     588         He has lied to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever told me.
2128321     588         And why – why?
2128322     588         I imagined that all was for my own sake.
2128323     588         But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands.
2128324     588         Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me?
2128325     588         Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?
2128326     588         Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back.
2128327     588         One thing I swear to you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend."
2128328     588         "I entirely believe you, madam," said Sherlock Holmes.
2128329     588         "The recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any material mistake.
2128330     588         The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?"
2128331     588         "He dictated it."
2128332     588         "I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?"
2128333     588         "Exactly."
2128334     588         "And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment?"
2128335     588         "He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us."
2128336     588         "He appears to be a very consistent character.
2128337     588         And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?"
2128338     588         "No."
2128339     588         "And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir Charles?"
2128340     588         "He did.
2128341     588         He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out.
2128342     588         He frightened me into remaining silent."
2128343     588         "Quite so.
2128344     588         But you had your suspicions?"
2128345     588         She hesitated and looked down.
2128346     588         "I knew him," she said.
2128347     588         "But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him."
2128348     588         "I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape," said Sherlock Holmes.
2128349     588         "You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet you are alive.
2128350     588         You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice.
2128351     588         We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again."
2128352     588         "Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us," said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town.
2128353     588         "I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.
2128354     588         Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own.
2128355     588         Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man.
2128356     588         But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night. "
2128357     588         The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage.
2128358     588         We all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together.
2128359     588         I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.
2128360     588         "Anything good?" he asked.
2128361     588         "The biggest thing for years," said Holmes.
2128362     588         "We have two hours before we need think of starting.
2128363     588         I think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor.
2128364     588         Never been there?
2128365     588         Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit."
2128366     588         Chapter 14 – The Hound of the Baskervilles
2128367     588         One of Sherlock Holmes's defects – if, indeed, one may call it a defect – was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.
2128368     588         Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances.
2128369     588         The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.
2128370     588         I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness.
2128371     588         The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be.
2128372     588         My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again.
2128373     588         Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.
2128374     588         Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation.
2128375     588         It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action.
2128376     588         We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.
2128377     588         "Are you armed, Lestrade?"
2128378     588         The little detective smiled.
2128379     588         "As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it."
2128380     588         "Good!
2128381     588         My friend and I are also ready for emergencies."
2128382     588         "You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes.
2128383     588         What's the game now?"
2128384     588         "A waiting game."
2128385     588         "My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place," said the detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire.
2128386     588         "I see the lights of a house ahead of us."
2128387     588         "That is Merripit House and the end of our journey.
2128388     588         I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper."
2128389     588         We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.
2128390     588         "This will do," said he.
2128391     588         "These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen."
2128392     588         "We are to wait here?"
2128393     588         "Yes, we shall make our little ambush here.
2128394     588         Get into this hollow, Lestrade.
2128395     588         You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?
2128396     588         Can you tell the position of the rooms?
2128397     588         What are those latticed windows at this end?"
2128398     588         "I think they are the kitchen windows."
2128399     588         "And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?"
2128400     588         "That is certainly the dining-room."
2128401     588         "The blinds are up.
2128402     588         You know the lie of the land best.
2128403     588         Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing – but for heaven's sake don't let them know that they are watched!"
2128404     588         I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained window.
2128405     588         There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.
2128406     588         They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.
2128407     588         Stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and distrait.
2128408     588         Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.
2128409     588         As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar.
2128410     588         I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel.
2128411     588         The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched.
2128412     588         Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an outhouse in the corner of the orchard.
2128413     588         A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within.
2128414     588         He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house.
2128415     588         I saw him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen.
2128416     588         "You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?" Holmes asked when I had finished my report.
2128417     588         "No."
2128418     588         "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?"
2128419     588         "I cannot think where she is."
2128420     588         I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog.
2128421     588         It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined.
2128422     588         The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface.
2128423     588         Holmes's face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
2128424     588         "It's moving towards us, Watson."
2128425     588         "Is that serious?"
2128426     588         "Very serious, indeed – the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans.
2128427     588         He can't be very long, now.
2128428     588         It is already ten o'clock.
2128429     588         Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path."
2128430     588         The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.
2128431     588         Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky.
2128432     588         Broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor.
2128433     588         One of them was suddenly shut off.
2128434     588         The servants had left the kitchen.
2128435     588         There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the muderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over their cigars.
2128436     588         Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house.
2128437     588         Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.
2128438     588         The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour.
2128439     588         As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea.
2128440     588         Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.
2128441     588         "If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us."
2128442     588         "Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?"
2128443     588         "Yes, I think it would be as well."
2128444     588         So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.
2128445     588         "We are going too far," said Holmes.
2128446     588         "We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us.
2128447     588         At all costs we must hold our ground where we are."
2128448     588         He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground.
2128449     588         "Thank God, I think that I hear him coming."
2128450     588         A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor.
2128451     588         Crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.
2128452     588         The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting.
2128453     588         He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear, starlit night.
2128454     588         Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us.
2128455     588         As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man who is ill at ease.
2128456     588         "Hist!" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol. "Look out!
2128457     588         It's coming!"
2128458     588         There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank.
2128459     588         The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it.
2128460     588         I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight.
2128461     588         But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement.
2128462     588         At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.
2128463     588         I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog.
2128464     588         A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen.
2128465     588         Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame.
2128466     588         Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.
2128467     588         With long bounds the huge black creatwe was leaping down the track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend.
2128468     588         So paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve.
2128469     588         Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him.
2128470     588         He did not pause, however, but bounded onward.
2128471     588         Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down.
2128472     588         But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds.
2128473     588         If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we could kill him.
2128474     588         Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night.
2128475     588         I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional.
2128476     588         In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound.
2128477     588         I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat.
2128478     588         But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank.
2128479     588         With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side.
2128480     588         I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.
2128481     588         Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen.
2128482     588         We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw. that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time.
2128483     588         Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move.
2128484     588         Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.
2128485     588         "My God!" he whispered.
2128486     588         "What was it?
2128487     588         What, in heaven's name, was it?"
2128488     588         "It's dead, whatever it is," said Holmes.
2128489     588         "We've laid the family ghost once and forever."
2128490     588         In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us.
2128491     588         It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two – gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness.
2128492     588         Even now in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire.
2128493     588         I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness.
2128494     588         "Phosphorus," I said.
2128495     588         "A cunning preparation of it," said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.
2128496     588         "There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent.
2128497     588         We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this fright.
2128498     588         I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.
2128499     588         And the fog gave us little time to receive him."
2128500     588         "You have saved my life."
2128501     588         "Having first endangered it.
2128502     588         Are you strong enough to stand?"
2128503     588         "Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything.
2128504     588         So!
2128505     588         Now, if you will help me up.
2128506     588         What do you propose to do?"
2128507     588         "To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures to-night. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall."
2128508     588         He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb.
2128509     588         We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.
2128510     588         "We must leave you now," said Holmes.
2128511     588         "The rest of our work must be done, and every moment is of importance.
2128512     588         We have our case, and now we only want our man.
2128513     588         "It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house," he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path.
2128514     588         "Those shots must have told him that the game was up."
2128515     588         "We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them."
2128516     588         "He followed the hound to call him off – of that you may be certain.
2128517     588         No, no, he's gone by this time!
2128518     588         But we'll search the house and make sure."
2128519     588         The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage.
2128520     588         There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored.
2128521     588         No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing.
2128522     588         On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.
2128523     588         "There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear a movement. Open this door!"
2128524     588         A faint moaning and rustling came from within.
2128525     588         Holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open.
2128526     588         Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.
2128527     588         But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see.
2128528     588         Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.
2128529     588         The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man.
2128530     588         In the centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof.
2128531     588         To this post a figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman.
2128532     588         One towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark eyes – eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning – stared back at us.
2128533     588         In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us.
2128534     588         As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck.
2128535     588         "The brute!" cried Holmes.
2128536     588         "Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!
2128537     588         Put her in the chair!
2128538     588         She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion."
2128539     588         She opened her eyes again.
2128540     588         "Is he safe?" she asked.
2128541     588         "Has he escaped?"
2128542     588         "He cannot escape us, madam."
2128543     588         "No, no, I did not mean my husband.
2128544     588         Sir Henry? Is he safe?"
2128545     588         "Yes."
2128546     588         "And the hound?"
2128547     588         "It is dead."
2128548     588         She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.
2128549     588         "Thank God!
2128550     588         Thank God!
2128551     588         Oh, this villain!
2128552     588         See how he has treated me!"
2128553     588         She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises.
2128554     588         "But this is nothing – nothing!
2128555     588         It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled.
2128556     588         I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool."
2128557     588         She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke.
2128558     588         "You bear him no good will, madam," said Holmes.
2128559     588         "Tell us then where we shall find him.
2128560     588         If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone."
2128561     588         "There is but one place where he can have fled," she answered.
2128562     588         "There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire.
2128563     588         It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he would fly."
2128564     588         The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the lamp towards it.
2128565     588         "See," said he.
2128566     588         "No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire to-night."
2128567     588         She laughed and clapped her hands.
2128568     588         Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment
2128569     588         "He may find his way in, but never out," she cried.
2128570     588         "How can he see the guiding wands to-night?
2128571     588         We planted them together, he and I, to mark the pathway through the mire.
2128572     588         Oh, if I could only have plucked them out to-day.
2128573     588         Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!"
2128574     588         It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted.
2128575     588         Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall.
2128576     588         The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved.
2128577     588         But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer.
2128578     588         The two of them were destined to travel together round the world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.
2128579     588         And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner.
2128580     588         On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog.
2128581     588         It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track.
2128582     588         We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog.
2128583     588         From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger.
2128584     588         Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet.
2128585     588         Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us.
2128586     588         Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us.
2128587     588         From amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting.
2128588     588         Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again.
2128589     588         He held an old black boot in the air.
2128590     588         "Meyers, Toronto," was printed on the leather inside.
2128591     588         "It is worth a mud bath," said he.
2128592     588         "It is our friend Sir Henry's missing boot."
2128593     588         "Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight."
2128594     588         "Exactly.
2128595     588         He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.
2128596     588         We know at least that he came so far in safety."
2128597     588         But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much which we might surmise.
2128598     588         There was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes.
2128599     588         If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night.
2128600     588         Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried.
2128601     588         Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his savage ally.
2128602     588         A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine.
2128603     588         Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp.
2128604     588         In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.
2128605     588         A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris.
2128606     588         "A dog!" said Holmes.
2128607     588         "By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel.
2128608     588         Poor Mortimer will never see his pet again.
2128609     588         Well, I do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed.
2128610     588         He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear.
2128611     588         On an emergency he could keep the hound in the outhouse at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his efforts, that he dared do it.
2128612     588         This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed.
2128613     588         It was suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death.
2128614     588         No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track.
2128615     588         It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor?
2128616     588         I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder" – he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of greensplotched bog which stretched away until it m
2128617     588         Chapter 15 – A Retrospection
2128618     588         It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker Street.
2128619     588         Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, w
2128620     588         My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery.
2128621     588         I had waited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past.
2128622     588         Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves.
2128623     588         They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.
2128624     588         "The whole course of events," said Holmes, "from the point of view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts
2128625     588         I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.
2128626     588         You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases."
2128627     588         "Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory."
2128628     588         "Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind.
2128629     588         Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed.
2128630     588         The barrister who has his case at his fingers' ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more.
2128631     588         So each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall.
2128632     588         To-morrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the infamous Upwood.
2128633     588         So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.
2128634     588         "My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville.
2128635     588         He was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name
2128636     588         He married Beryl Garcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.
2128637     588         His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home, and that he had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a success.
2128638     588         Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy.
2128639     588         The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of England.
2128640     588         I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.
2128641     588         "We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us.
2128642     588         The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate.
2128643     588         When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister.
2128644     588         The idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged.
2128645     588         He meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end.
2128646     588         His first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.
2128647     588         "The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared the way for his own death.
2128648     588         Stapleton, as I will continue to call him, knew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
2128649     588         So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.
2128650     588         He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
2128651     588         His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer.
2128652     588         "Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse.
2128653     588         An ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part.
2128654     588         The dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their possession.
2128655     588         He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks.
2128656     588         He had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe hiding-place for the creature.
2128657     588         Here he kennelled it and waited his chance.
2128658     588         "But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night.
2128659     588         Several times Stapleton lurked about with his hound, but without avail.
2128660     588         It was during these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation.
2128661     588         He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent.
2128662     588         She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.
2128663     588         Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.
2128664     588         She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock.
2128665     588         "He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.
2128666     588         By representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to understand.that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her.
2128667     588         His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide.
2128668     588         He must act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power.
2128669     588         He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London.
2128670     588         He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he had waited.
2128671     588         "Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting.
2128672     588         The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley.
2128673     588         In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim.
2128674     588         He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror.
2128675     588         The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man's was visible.
2128676     588         On seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned away again.
2128677     588         It was then that it left the print which was actually observed by Dr. Mortimer.
2128678     588         The hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.
2128679     588         "So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.
2128680     588         You perceive the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer.
2128681     588         His only accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective.
2128682     588         Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion against Stapleton.
2128683     588         Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.
2128684     588         Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him.
2128685     588         However, both of them were under his influence, and he had nothing to fear from them.
2128686     588         The first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained.
2128687     588         "It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in Canada.
2128688     588         In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville.
2128689     588         Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all.
2128690     588         He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her.
2128691     588         It was for this reason that he took her to London with him.
2128692     588         They lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence.
2128693     588         Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel.
2128694     588         His wife had some inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband – a fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment – that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger.
2128695     588         If the letter should fall into Stapleton's hands her own life would not be safe.
2128696     588         Eventually, as we know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand.
2128697     588         It reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.
2128698     588         "It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always have the means of setting him upon his track.
2128699     588         With characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design.
2128700     588         By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose.
2128701     588         He then had it returned and obtained another – a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a 
2128702     588         The more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.
2128703     588         "Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always by Stapleton in the cab.
2128704     588         From his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think that Stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this single Baskerville affair.
2128705     588         It is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which was any criminal ever arrested.
2128706     588         The last of these, at Folkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar.
2128707     588         I cannot doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.
2128708     588         "We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman.
2128709     588         From that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was no chance for him there.
2128710     588         He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet."
2128711     588         "One moment!" said I.
2128712     588         "You have, no doubt, described the sequence of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left unexplained.
2128713     588         What became of the hound when its master was in London?"
2128714     588         "I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of importance.
2128715     588         There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him.
2128716     588         There was an old manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony.
2128717     588         His connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years, as far back as the schoolmastering days, so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife.
2128718     588         This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.
2128719     588         It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England, while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.
2128720     588         The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious lisping accent.
2128721     588         I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out.
2128722     588         It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used.
2128723     588         "The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon followed by Sir Henry and you.
2128724     588         One word now as to how I stood myself at that time.
2128725     588         It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection for the watermark.
2128726     588         In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine.
2128727     588         There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition.
2128728     588         The scent suggested the presence of a lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.
2128729     588         Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country.
2128730     588         "It was my game to watch Stapleton.
2128731     588         It was evident, however, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard.
2128732     588         I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London.
2128733     588         My hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case.
2128734     588         I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action.
2128735     588         Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me.
2128736     588         I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.
2128737     588         "I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.
2128738     588         They were of great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton's.
2128739     588         I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood.
2128740     588         The case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores.
2128741     588         This also you cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations.
2128742     588         "By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to a jury.
2128743     588         Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man.
2128744     588         There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected, as a bait.
2128745     588         We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to his destruction.
2128746     588         That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him t
2128747     588         We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one.
2128748     588         A long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.
2128749     588         His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.
2128750     588         "It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.
2128751     588         There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incompatible emotions.
2128752     588         It was, at least, absolutely effective.
2128753     588         At his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder.
2128754     588         She was ready to warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again and again she tried to do so.
2128755     588         Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his
2128756     588         By encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired.
2128757     588         On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned suddenly against him.
2128758     588         She had learned something of the death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner.
2128759     588         She taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love.
2128760     588         Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down the baronet's death to
2128761     588         In this I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed.
2128762     588         A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an irjury so lightly.
2128763     588         And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case.
2128764     588         I do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained."
2128765     588         "He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound."
2128766     588         "The beast was savage and half-starved.
2128767     588         If its appearance did not frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered."
2128768     588         "No doubt.
2128769     588         There only remains one difficulty.
2128770     588         If Stapleton came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property?
2128771     588         How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?"
2128772     588         "It is a fomlidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it.
2128773     588         The past and the present are within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer.
2128774     588         Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions.
2128775     588         There were three possible courses.
2128776     588         He might claim the property from South America, establish his identity before the British authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in Lo
2128777     588         We cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty.
2128778     588         And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels.
2128779     588         I have a box for
2128780     588         'Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the De Reszkes?
2128781     588         Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?"
